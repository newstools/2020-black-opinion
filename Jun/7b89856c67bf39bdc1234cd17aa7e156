BLF President Andile Mngxitama Black First Land First (BLF) has received multiple complaints from the unemployed who have no means of survival but their applications for the Special Covid-19 Social Relief of Distress (SRD) Grant of R350 per month for six months, have been rejected by the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA). It looks like SASSA rejects applications arbitrarily. SASSA seems to have no clear objective criteria to assess the applications. This means that millions of poor and deserving people are excluded. BLF is compiling the numerous complaints it has received for submission next week to the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane. If you wish your complaint to be included in BLFâ€™s submission to the Public Protector, kindly transmit it to us via our official email: blackfirstlandfirst@gmail.com Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC) 20 June 2020 Contact Details Zanele Lwana
