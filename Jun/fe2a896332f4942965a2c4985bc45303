BLF President Andile Mngxitama On 19 June 1913, the whites only South African parliament gave whites 87% of the land stolen from blacks. 26 years after “democracy”, a black dominated parliament has failed to return the land. Black First Land First (BLF) warns again: there shall be no Land Expropriation Without Compensation. It was an empty promise by politicians who wanted the votes of the landless. Blacks are on their own!
