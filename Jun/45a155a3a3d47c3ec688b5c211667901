By Andile Mngxitama One of the ideas I was excited about when we first got to parliament was to end the crisis for black people (Colored and African) in Cape Town caused by floods and fires. My feeling was that a revolutionary movement in parliament would be able to mobilize the people to shutdown the institution until a real program of mass development for housing and infrastructure is rolled out. In my mind it was easy. After a flood or fire we would bring in 10 000 people from the townships and Cape Flats to occupy parliament with their sheer numbers. In this context Members of Parliament (MPs) would positively support and actively lead the process. It seemed so doable to me. But then people got too occupied with calling each other honorable and attacking President Zuma. Parliament and the street must be in a revolutionary embrace to end suffering. Imagine if the parliament disruptions are about real issues of our people, not empty stunts? It can be done. It must be done!
