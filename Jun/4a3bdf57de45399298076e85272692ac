Logo of Patriotic Alliance By BO Staff Writer Hairman Mashaba promotes himself as a no nonsense corruption buster. However, the former DA Johannesburg mayor has been reported to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) for stealing the party logo of Gayton McKenzie’s Patriotic Alliance (PA). The PA’s complaint follows Mashaba’s announcement that he is now turning his non-governmental organisation (NGO) into a political party to be registered with the IEC in August this year. McKenzie’s party saw red because Mashaba simply took its logo and colors. This is strange from a man who claims to fight corruption. There is another worrying element in how Mashaba does his politics. He, together with Mmusi Maimane, claimed that they are not starting a political party. In this way they attracted the unsuspecting people who want some kind of non governmental representation. There is no doubt that Mashaba knew from day one that he was building a NGO with the intention of converting it into a political party in the future. This is an indication of how voters are generally regarded by politicians. Mashaba seems to be as hypocritical as the other politicians. The PA has asked the IEC to reject the plagiarized logo of Mashaba’s party. It has further explained in its letter that it already has representation in key metros like Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni. Should the IEC accept the stolen logo, it would severely prejudice the PA in that it has already developed a reputable brand as a political party. It doesn’t make sense that Mashaba is unaware of the striking similarities between his logo and the logo of the PA. Hopefully the IEC will stop the hijacking of PA’s logo by a man who claims to be fighting against corruption.
