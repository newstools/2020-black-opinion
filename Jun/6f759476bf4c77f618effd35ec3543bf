Tshegofatso Pule (Left) and Naledi Phangindawo (right) The gruesome killings of two black women, 26-year-old Naledi Phangindawo and 28-year-old Tshegofatso Pule who were allegedly murdered by their respective boyfriends in the past week, is symptomatic of an ongoing war in the black community. We note that every year an average of 4000 black women are murdered; 1000 black children are murdered; and 15 000 black men are murdered. Until we realise that we are in the midst of a war zone, we wonâ€™t make progress. Blacks are dying in South Africa. The black man has been rendered a subhuman species who violates and kills without hesitation. Black First Land First (BLF) calls on black men to end this war on black women and on themselves. We further call for increased awareness, education and restorative justice to address the violence in the black communities, especially gender based violence. Black men are urged to dialogue amongst themselves and pledge their commitment to the black community to end the war. The war against women oppression must be won. May the deaths of Naledi and Tshegofatso not be in vain.
