By Andile Mngxitama They have started with breaking down the singularity of blackness. I have seen posts about LGBTI Lives Matter, Women’s Lives Matter, and Coloured Lives Matter. I’ve seen attempts to shift the burden of responsibility to fellow blacks with insertions of black on black transgressions. I’ve also heard bizarre things like Black Lives Matter only if it’s whites who kill blacks. Madness! Black people must stop playing white games. Since when are Coloureds, for instance, not black? These people are irritating. Always slicing up blackness to serve whiteness. If you are a Black Queer, why do you identify yourself away from blackness? Do police bullets ask your sexuality when they land on your black body? Please man pls! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
