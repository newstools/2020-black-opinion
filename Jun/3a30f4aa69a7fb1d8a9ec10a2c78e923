Black First Land First (BLF) calls on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Gates foundation) to stop exploiting the poor through their sponsored Covid-19 vaccines in South Africa (SA). The Gates foundation is targeting poor black people through cash incentives with their vaccines. This is unethical! The poor are too desperate for financial relief to be in a position to give informed consent. We call on President Cyril Ramaphosa, Members of Parliament (MPs) and wealthy white people to subject themselves to the Covid-19 vaccine trial. Let them risk their health and be the guinea pigs. Wits and Oxford universities need to do serious self introspection. They must allow good ethics to guide them and not seek glorification at the expense of the poor black people. It is bizarre that the Ramaphosa government would opt to endanger the lives of the poor and put them on the line for personal interests, knowing very well that these vaccines might be dangerous, while Madagascar has produced an effective remedy for Covid-19. This conduct leaves us with one conclusion! The vaccine trial is a material endeavor and is driven by personal interests in making profits.
