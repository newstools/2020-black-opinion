By Andile Mngxitama Karl Marx was a racist colonialist. Marxism is anti black. Marx and Marxism have NOTHING to offer blacks by way of understanding and organizing for black liberation. The black defenders of Marx aren’t keen to defend ‘die ou baas’ either. Anyway they are killing us not because we are workers; they are killing us because we are Black. Marx spoke for whites. Read him like you would read Adolf Hitler, Hendrik Verwoerd or Donald Trump. Have you seen how much black Marxists hate what they call the black bourgeoisie and the black petite bourgeois? These people are unpaid soldiers of white supremacy. They have no rage against white capitalists at all. We have enough black thinkers and philosophers to burden ourselves with Marx, who was worried about white people. On 31 May 2020, I engaged in a live debate with Lindokuhle Patiwe and Glenn Farred on the question of ‘Biko or Marx?’ in relation to my essay ‘Blacks Can’t Be Racist’. Watch the full debate to check how I arrived at my final word on Marx: https://youtu.be/Xsunz4iOLBI Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
