By BO Staff Writer On 16 June this year, Black First Land First (BLF) President Andile Mngxitama hosted a panel discussion with Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) heavyweights Dr Nchaupe Aubrey Mokoape and Prof Itumeleng Mosala on the place of the June 16, 1976 Soweto Uprising in the history of our struggle. The discussion was an explosion honoring the class of ‘76. We were educated about June 16’s true meaning. 16 June 1976 was not a “Youth Day”. It was an insurrection against oppression. The distortion of June 16 by the African National Congress (ANC) to tame it into a “Youth Day” is part of undermining the revolution. June 16 is Black Power Day!!!
