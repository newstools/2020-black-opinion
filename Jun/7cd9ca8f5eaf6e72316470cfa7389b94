By Andile Mngxitama White supremacy/racism/anti-blackness is an oppressive power reality which is a moving target. It’s always on the move; always mutating; always assimilating; always adapting – but NEVER changing its real character. It may even make concessions and compromises. Black people have to develop their Black Consciousness (BC) into a living set of tools of analysis which is able to keep up with white power’s mobility and sophistication. If you don’t do that, you will actually end up pushing the white agenda which has mutated to assimilate the black agenda. Beware of white power, it can even speak black! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
