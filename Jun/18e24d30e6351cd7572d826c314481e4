Collins Khosa By Andile Mngxitama Some of us have been complaining that the brand of feminism coming from the University of Cape Town (UCT) and the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) is liberal feminism and its job is to demonize the black man. We have raised our voices when black women joined hands with white women and marched against us. We said that we do not dispute that there is gender based violence (GBV) that must stop. We asked, “but why are you holding hands with people who have created the conditions for blacks to lead violent lives?“ The South African Army knows that the hatred for the black man has become official policy stemming from the hegemony of liberal feminism in the country. So they murdered Collins Khosa because he was a patriarchal misogynist pig? To this end Times Live reported, amongst other things, the following: “A lack of respect towards female soldiers and provocation were cited by a SANDF board of inquiry as the cause of a lockdown altercation before the death of Collins Khosa in Alexandra, Johannesburg. The board of inquiry found that soldiers and Johannesburg metro police who were accused of killing Khosa at his home could not be held liable for his death. It found that: “The cause of the incident was gender inequality and provocation, specifically lack [of] respect towards female soldiers by two men. The board recommended that programmes “should be developed to educate our citizen [sic] on gender equality specifically on security forces.” There you are. The message is clear – kill the black man! I’ve seen elsewhere that in fact Khosa was humiliated and beaten with sjamboks, the choice weapon of liberal feminism.
As we protest and show solidarity to our brothers and sisters who are murdered in the USA, let’s not forget what’s happening in South Africa. They are killing us in the name of feminism now. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
