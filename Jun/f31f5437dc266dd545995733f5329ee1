By Andile Mngxitama Beware of White Power. You will find the “woke” doing everything to avoid fighting white supremacy. Whites are in charge – but blacks are so scared of the real oppressor that they do everything to avoid fighting the real enemy. Blacks are elevating all the secondary contradictions. They say, for instance: i. fight Indians;
ii. fight Coloreds;
iii. fight “foreigners”;
iv. fight witches;
v. fight Christians;
vi. fight tokoloshes;
vii. fight patriarchs; and
viii. fight statues. Note, these are just secondary contradictions which are shaped by the maim contradiction which is the white oppression of the blacks globally. It’s the power of whiteness that makes us ready to fight secondary contradictions. People even start campaigns to say that Steve Biko was wrong to say that the main fight is with the white oppressor. Be careful of people who try to mobilize you into side fights to avoid the main fight. They serve white supremacy because they fear confronting white power. Stay woke!
