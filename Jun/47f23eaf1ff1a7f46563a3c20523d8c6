By Andile Mngxitama My biggest fear is the capacity of anti blackness to assimilate resistance to itself and render it its tool of oppression. That’s why the language of Black First Land First (BLF) is so clear. It can’t be assimilated into oppression, hence we get banned. The knee on George Floyd‘s neck is symbolic of the stranglehold of Black people but see how murderous cops are taking the knee. Is it still our symbol or has it been co-opted? When whites shout “I can’t breath”, haven’t they taken the last air out of our lungs? When for instance the University of Cape Town (UCT), without transforming itself, opens a decolonisation office or offers a course in this respect; and when law firms, imposing the Roman Dutch Law, make policies to have uncombed African hair as part of the sartorial representation of lawyers, beware! Oppression is the most adaptable system. It’s like a chameleon. We need to keep a step ahead or we will serve it even with our rage and tears. Andile Mngxitama is the President of BLF, a radical black consciousness organization.
