Black First Land First (BLF) will be engaged in numerous activities to highlight the failure of government to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic effectively. The consequence of this failure is that South Africa (SA) is now amongst the top 10 countries in the world with the worst record of infections. The government is digging graves instead of stopping mass death. The plan to dig mass graves is an indication of the governmentâ€˜s attitude to the pandemic. BLF is engaged in a campaign to #CloseTheGraves and has kickstarted the process with a petition to government. We demand that government stops digging mass graves and saves lives instead. The petition aims to gather 10 000 signatures after which it will be delivered to the president. Furthermore BLF together with other stakeholders will perform a prayer service and undertake a cleansing ceremony at a cemetery on Mandela Day. Details to be provided on a virtual press conference coming this Thursday. CLOSE THE PLANNED 1 MILLION GRAVES NOW! SAVE LIVES!!!.Sign the petition: http://chng.it/HvjWqpG8 #CloseTheGraves Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC) 12 July 2020 Contact Details Black First Land First Mail: blackfirstlandfirst@gmail.com Zanele Lwana
