BLF President Andile Mngxitama inspecting a cemetery in Gauteng Black First Land First (BLF) can confirm that the government is lying about the over 1 million Covid-19 mass graves. On Wednesday the Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku told the nation, “[w]e are preparing over 1.5 million grave sites, it is an uncomfortable discussion as a medical practitioner.” He also emphasized that the Covid-19 pandemic is a “reality we need to deal with, and we need to be prepared”. There is no ambiguity as to the fact that the MEC was referring to the mass graves being prepared for Covid-19 victims. As a consequence of the backlash from society the Gauteng Government (GP) tried to spin this mass graves mess with a statement that seeks to cause confusion. They now say that “[t]he province does not have over a million already open dug graves, the over a million graves refers to the collective capacity municipalities can take.” The truth is that the GP government is digging Covid-19 graves all over the province‘s cemeteries. BLF can confirm that cemeteries in GP have been instructed to dig extra mass graves for Covid-19 victims. The government is lying. We reiterate our call for the graves to be closed and all focus to be in saving lives. The mass death policy of the government is killing too many. Seven children, under the age of 10 years, have died in Gauteng in one week. BLF will continue to investigate these mass graves as part of its #closegraves campaign. A letter will be written to the GP MEC of Health and the Minister of Health to ask them to close the graves and focus on saving lives Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC) 11 July 2020 Contact Details Black First Land First Mail: blackfirstlandfirst@gmail.com Zanele Lwana
