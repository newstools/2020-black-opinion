The South African government has shown its utter disregard for life with its 1.5 million graves program in response to the Covid-19 crisis. There is no excuse or explanation that can wash away this fact. Instead of building hospitals; paying and protecting our frontline health workers; and shutting down schools and building and repairing others, government has exposed our children and educators to death. Instead of giving the poor the promised relief of R350, the government is digging graves. The government has insulted us as citizens and undermined our ancestors. We call on the government to close those graves without any further delay. We demand that government apologizes to the nation and does the right thing for a change by saving the people. We say close the graves! No we wonâ€™t allow the government to kill us. Now its time for action Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC) 10 July 2020 Contact Details Black First Land First Mail: blackfirstlandfirst@gmail.com Zanele Lwana
