Black First Land First (BLF) is shattered by the passing on of Advocate Victor Mdelwa Simelane, a long time friend of our movement. We received the news of his passing on the day of his funeral. As a revolutionary movement committed to black liberation, we had a trusted friend in Advocate Simelane in his quiet manner. Many black professionals promise to assist our movement, very few actually do step up when the need arises. Advocate Simelane was one of those few who did step up when we were in need the most. It was Advocate Simelane who took over the case of the BLF26 who were arrested as a consequence of the then Public Protector, Advocate Thuli Madonsela, choosing to shield the corruption of the likes of Johann Rupert. The state had used the case against the BLF 26 to harass them. It was through his legal acumen and commitment to justice that the case was in fact thrown out of court. He attended to our case for over two years, doing it pro bono and being there at every hearing. BLF had a tower of strength, a shoulder to cry on in Advocate Simelane. We shall always remember our friends at the hour of need. We can only repay such loyalty with an unwavering committment to the liberation of our people. Hamba kahle Comrade Simelane, the peopleâ€™s lawyer!
