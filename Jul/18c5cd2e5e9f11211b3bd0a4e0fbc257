Black First Land First (BLF) fully agrees with Brother Louis Farrakhan’s warning against the vaccines developed by people who have an agenda of depopulation and control for profits. We in Africa are most vulnerable because most our leaders are servants of the murderous west. The pro white government of South Africa (SA) has already started with testing Bill Gates’ vaccines on the poor. They starve the people and then give them a bit of money to eat in exchange for surrendering into being lab rats. Africa has its own African bred remedies which our governments are rejecting. Madagascar has developed an effective natural remedy but our governments are not using it to help us. Instead we are subjected to dangerous vaccines developed by people who have an agenda of exterminating us. Here Brother Farrakhan gives correct advise: “I say to my brothers and sisters in Africa, if they come up with a vaccine, be careful. Don’t let them vaccinate you with their history of treachery through vaccines, through medication”. We agree with him. In SA black people are now entering a frightening phase of death through Covid-19. These deaths are unnecessary because the government did so little to protect the poor and vulnerable. They hope to use the terror of death to break our resistance to the agenda of mass murder of Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates. We vow to continue the resistance. Farrakhan is correct. We shall remain alert.
