The President of Black First Land First (BLF), Andile Mngxitama, has been suspended from Facebook for three days following his comment against the Covid-19 vaccines. BLF has come out strong against the Covid-19 vaccines. We believe that there is a tyrannical regime to impose the vaccines which are not tested for safety and are likely to cause major health problems, including corruption of the DNA. We shall not be silenced. We refuse to live under the dictatorship of Stellenbosch and the pharmaceutical companies, some of which are the donors of the CR17 campaign. Covid-19 needs non intrusive responsible responses, not fear mongering to terrorise us into silence and vaccines. BLF notes the silence of all the major political parties in parliament on the Bill Gates vaccines. We support the prayer of the Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, calling on God to destroy Covid-19 vaccines that may corrupt the DNA of people. We further call on all genuine men and women of God to pray against the devilish agenda around Covid-19.
