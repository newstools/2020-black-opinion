By Andile Mngxitama Cyril Ramaphosa will pay R283 million of our money as a deposit for the monster Covid-19 vaccines. But there is no money for: 1. Healthcare;
2. Free education;
3. Housing;
4. Job provision; and
5. Other basic needs. And oh, the loud mouth politicians in parliament are silent. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
