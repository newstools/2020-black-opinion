By Andile Mngxitama Some people liked us because we defended President Zuma. The same people now hate us for defending Prophet Bushiri against the same enemy which is fighting President Zuma. See, such people never understood why we support President Zuma. They are happy that we are supporting someone whom they are fans of. We don’t do fans stuff, we do Black Consciousness. And the real mark of Black Consciousness is when you are able to defend a black person you don’t even like who comes under attack from the enemy. We are guided by the philosophy of Black Consciousness and its principles. We don’t do whims and likes. Only a fool wouldn’t see that Major 1 is under attack from the enemy. He is young, gifted and black! If you don’t understand Black Consciousness, you won’t understand us. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
