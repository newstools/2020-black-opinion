Arabs donâ€™t respect Africans and have never asked for forgiveness for enslaving Africans. The constant harassment of Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng is part of this Arab anti African practice which has not stopped since the annexation of North Africa. The so-called Africa for Palestine is an anti black organization masquerading as a human rights group. Its main job is to silence Africans who threaten the racist status quo. Black First Land First (BLF) calls on the anti black group to immediately stop harassing our Chief Justice. The group is soiling the good history of the support of South African blacks for the Palestinian struggle. It is clear that this group is weaponizing solidarity with the Palestinian people to drive an anti black agenda. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng has freedom of religion like all other citizens. He likewise has freedom of opinion, including on the vaccination process which is often used by the medical establishment to hurt people the world over. We shall not allow anyone to bully any black person under our watch. We call on the followers of Islam of the so-called Africa for Palestine to respect Africans.
