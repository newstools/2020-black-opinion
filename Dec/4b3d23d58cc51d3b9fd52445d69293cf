By Andile Mngxitama Our great mother Sojourner Truth, a soldier against slavery, soldier for women’s rights. She had a fighting Jesus by her side. Below is an extract from her famous speech (1851) which inspired Bell Hooks, the renowned thinker on liberation of women. Christianity is a weapon. Use it to liberate the land. We are at peace, for we know victory is certain. The devil is a liar! Good morning children of Papa. Have a great day …… “Ain’t I a Woman? That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages
and lifted over ditches and to have the best place everywhere.
Nobody helps me any best place.
And ain’t I a woman?
Look at me! Look at my arm.
I have plowed, I have planted, and I have gathered into barns.
And no man could head me.
And ain’t I a woman?
I could work as much and eat as much as man—when I could get it—
and bear the lash as well!
And ain’t I a woman?
I have borne children
and seen most of them sold into slavery,
and when I cried out with a mother’s grief, none but Jesus heard me.
And ain’t I a woman?” Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
