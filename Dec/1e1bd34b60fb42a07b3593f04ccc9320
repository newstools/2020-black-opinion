By Andile Mngxitama Too many people are dying from Covid-19. We really have to pray and take precautions. The plan of the enemy is to kill our people until we submit in fear. We have to destroy their plan by taking precautions, by educating each other, and by making sure we elect a goverment that would put us first. Drinking places packed to the hilt in townships is a recipe for our defeat. Buy your drinks, sit in open air spaces, and avoid large crowds in enclosed places. Please… The virus has been unleashed. We must protect ourselves where possible… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
