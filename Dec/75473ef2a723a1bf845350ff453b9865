By Andile Mngxitama The real reasons why they are persecuting Major 1 is because: i. White Monopoly Capital is threatened by his success; ii. Stellenbosch wants his businesses; and iii. they won’t allow a black person to succeed in South Africa. But they don’t know the Hokma Wisdom. We are going to stop these evil forces! The devil is a liar. The God of Major 1 is a living God! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
