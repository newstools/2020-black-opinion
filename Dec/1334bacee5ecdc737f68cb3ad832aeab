A Magistrateâ€™s Court in Cape Town has evicted a black family from its property and given it to a white racist. This is happening today in South Africa. It goes to show once more that blacks are not protected by law in this country. The courts side with whites to oppress black people. The white man has been squatting at the property for almost a year without paying any rent and without a lease agreement. The owners, because they are black and have bought property in a white suburban area, are denied the right to occupy their own family home. Black First Land First (BLF) condemns the decision of the magistrate to evict blacks from their own property and to hand it to a white squatter who has no right or permission to occupy the property.
