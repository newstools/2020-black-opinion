By Andile Mngxitama Stellenbosch has made sure that the ANC is broke. It has chased and locked up all the ANC donors like Edwin Sodi. Only Stellenbosch is permitted to be an ANC donor. The irony of this situation is that the ANC is broke but itâ€™s President is a billionaire. What a joke! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
