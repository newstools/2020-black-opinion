By Andile Mngxitama We shall never join the new found hate for Nelson Mandela by the white world he saved from the black wrath. Ingratiates! The new fashion of hating Nelson Mandela is functional to the imperialist project of Robin Renwick who associates the support of the ANC with the legacy of Mandela. For their project 2019 to work, they need to weaken the ANC significantly. That’s why they have made it possible for individuals to stand for President without a political party. In their scenario planning they have factored in the remote possibility of Ramaphosa losing the coming elective conference of the ANC. Should that highly unlikely scenario come to pass then Ramaphosa will form a party or run as an independent, and together with the DA and the EFF form a government agreeable to London and Stellenbosch. The attack on Mandela is part of eroding any allegiance people have to the ANC because of Mandela. So the constant attacks on the legacy of Mandela is not innocent. It’s part of the London/Stellenbosch agenda. Right now the ANC is captured by Stellenbosch. It’s a tool against blacks. They hope to keep it that way because it’s easy. Blacks vote for Stellenbosch thinking they are voting for themselves. But white monopoly capital is concerned that should Ramaphosa lose an elective conference, then this weapon called the ANC shall fall into the hands of the RET forces. So they are preparing for that eventuality. Should that happen then the weapon called the ANC must be significantly weakened hence the attack on Mandela’s legacy. To be clear, Mandela is not a saint but we must not unwittingly find ourselves pushing agendas we don’t understand against Madiba. Being woke is already being anticipated by the enemy and can be used against the black agenda. To understand the political process, one needs to have a bit of Hokma wisdom. Fire!!! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
