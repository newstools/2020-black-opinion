By Andile Mngxitama There are some clever blacks who are making snide remarks about Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng being a Christian who invokes the name of Jesus to intervene in human affairs and protect us from evil. These people will never ridicule Islamic scholars and professionals who observe Islamic injunctions. They will never say people who close their shops for two hours every Friday are lunatics. In South Africa right now only two senior civil servants have been consistantly righteous and both are committed Christians – the Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane and CJ Mogoeng Mogoeng. Genuine atheists can never be affected or be bothered by a Christian prayer. In SA we don’t have atheists we have the anti Christ and devil worshippers. South African journalists are pseudo atheists. We know their religion is white monopoly capital and their gods are Johann Rupert and the Oppenheimers. Their unholy city is Stellenbosch. The attack on the CJ is orchestrated by the devil…. And between Bill Gates, the master of the 666 beast, and Mogoeng Mogoeng and his belief in Jesus, I trust Mogoeng Mogoeng. Be good, love black people and stand for the truth whatever what. That’s part of being servants of the Lord. Victory is certain! The devil in Stellenbosch is a liar!!!
