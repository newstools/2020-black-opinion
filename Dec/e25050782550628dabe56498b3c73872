By Andile Mngxitama May we all pray/mediate/think deeply about the state of black people the world over this morning. May we ask for wisdom and courage to be truthful to the task of black liberation. Evil shall not triumph. With our prayers
With our brains
With our hands
With our faith
We shall defeat the enemy and let God’s people go! See you in Lilongwe! 31st December Crossover Night…. we shall be there! Good morning and have a great day. Stellenbosch shall fall!!! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
