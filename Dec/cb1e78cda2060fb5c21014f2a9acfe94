By Andile Mngxitama I watched a bit of the Constitutional Court proceedings on the application by Public Protector and others to overturn the shockingly evil decision of the North Gauteng High Court where it was found that it’s ok for Ramaphosa to lie to Parliament about getting money from Bosasa to buy the ANC conference in order to be President. Earlier this year the High Court set aside Mkhwebane’s report on the CR17 campaign funding. Yes, the court has decided that Ramaphosa can lie to Parliament. Also the court has ruled that the donors that gave Ramaphosa the R1 billion must be kept a secret. The Bosasa loot is part of the R1 billion he got to buy the path to the Presidency. Ramaphosa lied daylight in Parliament. Listening to the court’s questions, it’s clear that a majority will deny the Public Protector’s application for leave to appeal the evil decision of the High Court. They will protect Ramaphosa and Stellenbosch. There is no law in South Africa. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
