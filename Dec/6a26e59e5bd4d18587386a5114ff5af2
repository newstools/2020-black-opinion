By Andile Mngxitama Dr Nchaupe Aubrey Mokoape. A great mind has ceased to think. A revolutionary to the end. Eternal youth… On June 16 this year, I was privileged to be in conversation with this great tower and close friend of one of our Prophets, Steve Biko. I’m honored to have had such interactions. You can watch the conversation here: https://youtu.be/cfn9xLvX5Wg… I had been scheming to go see him… He taught us that age shouldn’t make you reactionary. He was revolutionary to the end! He made his contribution. I refuse to cry. If we really love and honour him, we must complete the Azanian Revolution… This loss is too much… We shall miss you, tower of towers!!! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
