By Andile Mngxitama These matric paper leaks seem to be a system used all the time for a privileged few. Apparently Provinces hand-pick “top achievers” and feed them everything. Problem is, technology has democratized the “leaks”. Now they are punishing everyone. It’s madness. Leave the children alone. I’m sure if they were serious they would look at the year marks and sort this out. In any even, an exam is a bogus system of assessment. Nonsense!
