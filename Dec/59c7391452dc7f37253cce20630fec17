By Andile Mngxitama Iâ€™m convinced that without Christianity correctly interpreted blacks shall never be freed. We are a Christian people as a matter of historical fact and contemporary reality. Our job is to identify true prophets who are not captured by Stellenbosch such as Major 1. From there we free the land and the people as Steve Biko had taught us. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
