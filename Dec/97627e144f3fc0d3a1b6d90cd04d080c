By Andile Mngxitama This is Johann Rupert, the man who controls the top three political parties in parliament. He is the ruler of South Africa (SA) together with the Oppenheimers. His headquarters is in Stellenbosch. True story. Johann Rupert is using his tobacco factories and tobacco leaves to create a vaccine for Covid-19. They are going to shoot tobacco through our bodies with needles. Addiction ya nicotine fela mo. One of Rupert‘s companies is called British American Tobacco (BAT) which manufactures and sells cigarettes for profit. Now they are turning their tobacco into Covid-19 vaccines. Yes, you heard right. Cigarette manufacturers are now permitted to use tobacco to manufacture Covid-19 vaccines. The respected Guardian (UK) reports: “British American Tobacco has moved a step closer to producing a vaccine for coronavirus using tobacco plants, as it won approval in the US to begin testing on humans. “The company behind cigarette brands including Lucky Strike, Rothmans and Benson & Hedges said the US Food & Drug Administration had given it clearance to begin a clinical study with adult volunteers.” Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
