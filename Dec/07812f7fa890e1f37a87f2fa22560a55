By Andile Mngxitama When we take power, the first thing is to fire all the judges that are captured by Stellenbosch! These are the people who stop progress… A black person who believes the judiciary of South Africa (SA) is fair, is like a chicken that thinks Nandos is a place where chickens get justice. The SA judiciary is captured. Stellenbosch paid Ramaphosa R1 billion to become President of SA. Anyone who is seen as a threat by Stellenbosch is ill-treated by both the National Prosecuting Authority and the judges. The judges helped to cover-up Ramaphosa’s corruption by sealing the names of his bosses who bought him and the ANC conference. Evil people! Now the same biased judges will also rule against the Public Protector, Advocate Mkhwebane, because she isn’t the Stellenbosch favorite. This is the same treatment Major1 is receiving. Parliament is also captured, that’s why it’s quiet. We must stop complaing and start organizing to remove this government. There is no other solution! Organize! Organize! Organize! Together we shall be victorious! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
