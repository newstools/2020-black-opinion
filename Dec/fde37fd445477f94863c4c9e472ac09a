By Andile Mngxitama The job of a true revolutionary is to seek the shortest route to liberation whilst suffering minimum casualties. A revolutionary movement must unite with all who are aggrieved by the ruling power to seek change. Only reactionaries who pretend to want change put their religious prejudices ahead of the accumulation of revolutionary momentum to end oppression. As one bearded thinker once said, we make history but not under conditions determined by ourselves. A revolutionary movement must see when there is a groundswell towards change and work with that. We no longer want to rescue the ANC, we want to remove it from the picture. It shall be done! We want our land back. We want our God given minerals back. We want black people to be treated with dignity and love. Thatâ€™s our vision! Join the movement for change. Shalom! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
