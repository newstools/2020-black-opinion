Dear BLF members It’s been a while since I last sent you a direct message. Firstly, we have been working tirelessly to prepare our movement for the 2021 Local Government Elections (LGE). With regards to this, we shall be making an official announcement soon. Secondly, we have launched the online membership process. It’s easy and please, as far as possible, join online and encourage others to do the same. Thirdly, the first batch of membership cards shall be dispatched to members by Christmas 2020. Thereafter all should get their membership cards within a reasonable time from registration. Fourthly, T-shirts are being organized for sale. Orders will be open soon. We ask you to buy in bulk to save on postage. Fifthly, please note that we are working on a policy on religion. The Black Agenda is fairly silent on this question. In the meantime, please exercise religious tolerance and work with all religious denominations. Currently, many members of the Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG) have expressed interest in working with BLF to defeat the evil government of Ramaphosa and Stellenbosch, which is persecuting black people. I ask that you cooperate and work as family with ECG members to realise the objective of black liberation. Please focus your energy on the LGE2021. We need to get there organized and ready. Yours in struggle Andile Mngxitama
BLF: President
