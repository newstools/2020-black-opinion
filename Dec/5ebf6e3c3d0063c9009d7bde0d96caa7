By Andile Mngxitama There are some amongst us who claim to be woke and are embarrassed by the fact that the founders of real wokeness were almost all Christians. I mean who can be more woke than: i. Marcus Garvey;
ii. Robert Sobukwe; and
iii. Steve Biko? We can’t conceal the totality of the belief system of our forefathers in the struggle.
Christianity never stopped anyone from struggling against oppression. In fact, it’s a sin that we have allowed a minority from Europe to come here and harass and even murder our leaders and prophets and take our land. The fight for land and dignity is the responsibility of all true Christians. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
