Black First Land First (BLF) is shocked at the report that the Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, is facing an arrest. This arrest is clearly orchestrated by the State President, Cyril Ramaphosa, who is doing the dirty work of his donors who have been exposed by the Public Protector. Ramaphosa must immediately stop the harassment of the Public Protector by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) which has become the choice weapon of Stellenbosch which in turn has bought Ramaphosa with R1 billion. The attack on the Public Protector is a political ploy to silence her and to prepare the nation for the process to remove her from office before her tenure ends. Ramaphosaâ€™s donors do not want the current Public Protector because she is not controlled by them. They are furthermore still angry about her ruling against ABSA in the apartheid lifeboat case as well as her ruling on the CR17 donations. This move is nothing but a political vendetta by a criminal gang. Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC)
