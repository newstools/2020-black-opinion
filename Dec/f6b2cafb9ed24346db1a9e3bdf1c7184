By Andile Mngxitama Bazalwane we must pray for black people in the DA. They are abused day and night by those racists whites who hate blacks. At this moment our sister Phumzile Van Damme is being attacked. Let our black sisters and brothers see the light. I see some black people are celebrating the fact that Phumzile is being kicked out of the DA. No we can’t celebrate any attack on blacks, including those who refuse to listen to our good advice. The thing is that racism attacks ALL blacks. It doesn’t care if you are woke or you are in the DA. That’s why we must defend all blacks when under attack and ask questions later. There is a real home for them in BLF. They must leave that Babylon. We must keep on asking blacks in the DA to leave that racist organization. But when they are attacked, we must defend them. Racists have no right to be racist. Blacks must wake up. We are all under attack. And as a comrade said earlier, “black love is not reserved for perfect blacks”. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
