By Andile Mngxitama Just this month alone, three cases have gone to court where the judiciary openly sided with whites against innocent blacks, namely: 1. In Houtbay, Cape Town, a white man decided to illegally occupy a beautiful house bought by a black family for a year, refusing to leave and without paying a cent. The black family moved in. The white man then went to court and ultimately got a magistrate, who was possibly a drinking buddy, to issue an eviction order against the black owners. 2. In Potchefstroom, my brother Mbulelo and Tseko Nkhane fought an illegal eviction of a farm worker family by a white farmer. They even managed to get a court interdict and a warrant to arrest the white farmer if he again cut the water and electricity of the farm worker. Then one night, the white magistrate and white police literally constituted a night court and evicted the poor black farm worker. 3. Last week here in Johannesburg, the court issued an inexplicable eviction notice for the poor of Rabie Ridge. So when I look at how they are treating the Public Protector and how the very same courts have treated many others, including Major 1, I know that we need to get political power to fix this country. When we have political power, no magistrate or judge will abuse their power. NEVER! Letâ€™s join BLF, register to vote and use our votes to fix SA. It shall be done! We start with Tshwne and Joburg in 2021LGE! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
