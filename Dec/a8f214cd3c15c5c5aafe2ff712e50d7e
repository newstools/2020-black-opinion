By Andile Mngxitama May these two servants of our Lord Jesus Christ be saved.
We pray for the fall of Stellenbosch dear God of Major 1.
We pray for wisdom and love.
We pray that all sellouts be exposed and your judgement come upon them with fire!
In your name dear Lord, may our land stolen by demons from Europe be returned.
We pray for Land Expropriation Without Compensation now!
We pray for our Prophet. We know in your mighty name he shall return to this country.
We pray for health and the defeat of Covid-19 and all the evil plans to corrupt our DNA.
In Jesus name.
Victory is certain!
Amen! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
