By Andile Mngxitama After 500 years, every black leader (spiritual, political, intellectual etc) who is a threat to the white system is: 1. demonised
2. accused of being corrupt
3. accused of being a criminal
4. accused of being a rapist if he is a man If the above doesn’t work to neutralise such leaders, they will be assassinated. I’m shocked that people who claim to be woke can’t see what’s happening to Major 1. We blacks don’t know what has happened to us in the last 500 years. We are a tragic people. That’s why we are still oppressed the world over. The enemy determines our actions and feelings. But this stops now! We shall only concern ourselves with those blacks who are willing to club together with us to defend ourselves against a vicious enemy that has been destroying us for the last 500 years. If you hate black people, please do not waste our time. Do not engage us. We are unreasonable in the defence of black people. Thank you. Peace! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
