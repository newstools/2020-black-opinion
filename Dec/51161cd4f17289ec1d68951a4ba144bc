By Andile Mngxitama Do you know why the entire Stellenbosch establishment attacked CJ Mogoeng Mogoeng for his comment about evil vaccines? Itâ€™s because: 1. Johann Rupert owns a company called British American Tobacco (BAT). 2. Pravin Gordhan has shares in BAT. 3. BAT is a cigarette manufacturer and marketing company. 4. BAT has excessive tobacco from its tobacco plantations. 5. BAT has diverted its tobacco into Covid-19 vaccines. Therefore, the prayer of the CJ threatens the evil vaccines of Johann Rupert. Get it now? Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
