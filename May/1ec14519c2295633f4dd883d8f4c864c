Tito Mboweni. Image: pintrest By Andile Mngxitama Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said on Tuesday that white South African businesses must be given state money. To this end white businesses don’t have to be Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEEE) compliant to qualify for state money. This means that untransformed white businesses will get public money. In the same breath Mboweni maintains that foreign owned Spaza Shops must be closed – he wants to kick out our people from outside South Africa (SA) and give the township economy to white monopoly capital (WMC). Does this make sense? Or is it that he knows that blacks have become stupid and will accept this because we are so colonised and glorify whiteness? How can you shutdown Spaza Shops of blacks from outside SA and then incentivise white businesses who refuse to transform? Who stole our land and made us poor? The New Dawn brigade is too confident. They are serving the white agenda openly. They are fighting to entrench the Stellenbosch agenda. In the meantime while blacks are starving through the Covid-19 crisis, the pseudo Marxist-Leninist opposition party is asking government to allow for the sale of gym equipment. Vuka Darkie! Educate! Agitate! Organize! Andile Mngxitama is the President of BLF, a radical black consciousness organization.
