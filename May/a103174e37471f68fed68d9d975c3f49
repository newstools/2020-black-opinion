By Kamvelihle Goba Big up to Andile Mngxitama and Mpho Matsitle for the platform as well as for insisting on uncharted conversations. What is important about conversations of this nature is not agreement but having the conversation itself. Never get tired of teaching Andile. Masixole Mlandu generally has a beautiful mind. Insights from Simthandile Tyhali and Thobani Zikalala were equally great. I still insist Fees Must Fall (FMF) is a socio-economic reality of a Rhodes which has never fallen since pursuit of National Liberation. These two moments, without pitting the one as more important than the other, are expressions in higher education of the unresolved national question – how we blacks understand our place in racist-capitalist South Afrika. Perhaps like true students we must put this down on paper, as progressive forces of the movement are yet to write their insights about the period – as peers, as comrades, but also as a generation in charge of our story! Years later, Biko is still vindicated; Blacks Can’t Be Racist!
