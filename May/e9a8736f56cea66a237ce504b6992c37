By Andile Mngxitama All the reactionary political parties and organised labour have entered into a class collaboration with Cyril Ramaphosa. They have resorted to giving alms to the same white monopoly capital (WMC) which is looting the state through the pandemic. Forces of reaction are colluding with the State to deceive and repress the people towards capital accumulation. Our people are once more betrayed by those they have entrusted to represent them. We must insist on turning the Covid-19 crisis into a revolutionary crisis. Black First Land First (BLF) is clear! We say: 1. Give the people their R350
2. No to rentals
3. No to evictions
4. Adjust the poor salaries of Essential Services & Frontline workers
5. Free data for all
6. Food prices must be reduced to cost prices
7. Prioritize black businesses
8. No WMC spaza shops in our townships
9. Land must return so that we can plant our own food
10. Bring Madagascarâ€™s Covid-Organics to South Africa now Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
