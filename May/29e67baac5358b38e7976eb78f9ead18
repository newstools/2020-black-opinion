By Andile Mngxitama As we are focused on the R350 insult regarding the Special Covid-19 Social Relief of Distress (SRD) Grant and our demand for 10% of the R500 billion coronavirus stimulus package that can give 5 million people a total of R10 000 each for six months amounting to each getting R1600 per month – there is this perplexing situation: 1. Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma (NDZ) is by law responsible for all regulations around Covid-19, right?
2. How are they agreeing to open schools but keep bottle stores shut?
3. Or are they saying that it’s OK to die for education? Note I’m not arguing for bottle stores to open. But my mind struggles to understand the logic of opening schools but closing bottle stores. Their decision strikes me as being reckless with the lives of our children. Maybe someone has a better explanation to make me understand. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
