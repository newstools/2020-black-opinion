By Andile Mngxitama All work is evil under a racist capitalist patriarchal system. Sex work is not work. It’s the further degradation and dehumanization of people – of those who sell themselves and those who employ them – by this evil system. We don’t elevate begging to a morally acceptable standard. We can reject sex work without propagating the idea that someone, who is so desperate so as to end up selling her/himself to eat, should be arrested or molested. We can do this, just as we don’t advocate for beggars to be criminalized and harassed. Our job as black revolutionaries is not to normalize the conditions that create degradation and dehumanization but to labour intensely to end the conditions that make our people exist below the acceptable level. We must not allow white women’s thinking to justify the horror we live through. Sex workers don’t sell their labour power. They sell themselves. Know the difference especially if you claim to be a Marxist. EDUCATE! AGITATE! ORGANIZE! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
