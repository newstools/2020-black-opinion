By Andile Mngxitama I have received very encouraging messages from the student leadership of the 1992 to 1996 and the 2000 to 2007 generations, who were inspired by the conversation we had last night (17 May 2020) with some brilliant fallists on the influences or otherwise of my essay ‘Blacks Can’t Be Racist’ on the Rhodes Must Fall (RMF)/Fees Must Fall (FMF) moments. We need an intergenerational student leadership conversation. It’s remarkable how big the gaps in memory are and how each generation reinvents the wheel and suffer the same historical loses. I’m also enjoying the bits of different takes going on from the debate ignited by my engagement with the fallists. As the author of the text, nothing gives me more pleasure than an intellectual controversy with all its horrors and splendor. Others wish to commit patricide. Next month we shall have another discussion on the relation of ‘Blacks Can’t Be Racist‘ with the class June 16, 1976. Our panelists will feature different generations in conversation. I’m looking forward to this one. Again, thanks to my esteemed fellow panelists Thobani Zikalala; Simthandile Tyhali; Kamvelihle Goba; and Masixole Mlandu. This is potentially huge!!!
