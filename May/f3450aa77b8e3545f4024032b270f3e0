Former President Jacob Zuma By BO Staff Writer Jacob Zuma recently withdrew his application to the Constitutional Court (ConCourt) for leave to appeal the decision of the lower court which had denied his application for the permanent stay of prosecution on 11 December 2019. The former president’s case was accordingly scheduled to go on in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on June 23, 2020. He faces what appears to be 4 main charges of corruption involving a total of R4 million that passed between comrades (Zuma and Schabir Shaik) in the period between 1996 to 2005 – if indeed the State has a case. Reports last week subsequently allege that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has found that further payments were made by Shaik to Zuma. It is instructive that the Senior State advocate, Billy Downer, is prosecuting this case. In the following series of tweets Black First Land First (BLF) President Andile Mngxitama responded sharply to what he regards as the continued persecution of Zuma: Andile Mngxitama (@BlaqPerspective)

Billy Downer went to get an discredited afrikaner with possible apartheid and broederbond sympathies to help him concoct charges against Zuma. You may have heard that there is “new” evidence of payments between Zuma/ Shaik its the attempt to give a new gloss on an ancient thing Andile Mngxitama (@BlaqPerspective)

To solve this KPMG problem Downer went to the same Johan van der Walt now with FTI and asked him to “revamp” (lol) the ancient K PMG report and now present it as new under his new outfit FTI. PLEASE NOTE: Johann van der Walt was fired and his report on Pravin Gordhan withdrawn Andile Mngxitama (@BlaqPerspective)

#NPAvsZuma
The NPA has become the weapon to settle political scores against #Zuma for his role in the liberation struggle and for pushing RET. Billy Downer the apartheid prosecutor has made it his job to avenge the fall of apartheid. Andile Mngxitama (@BlaqPerspective)

Billy Downer is a graduate of the bastion of white supremacy the Stellenbosch University where its alleged he may have had dealings with the Broederbond which was the arch enemy of #Zuma. Downer seem to have been inherited from apartheid prosecutor authority. Andile Mngxitama (@BlaqPerspective)

Downer has made it his life mission to get #Zuma. Already the state has allowed Downer to waste over R100 million chasing an allegation of less than R4 million which is money exchanging hands between comrades over 10 years period. Its like ewallets between friends. Andile Mngxitama (@BlaqPerspective)

Billy Downer never had any evidence against Zuma that’s why he was not charged to gether with Shabir; Bulelani himself said so at the time. But the whole thing was resuscitated much later in an effort to stop #Zuma from becoming President of the ANC in Polokwane. Andile Mngxitama (@BlaqPerspective)

The bogus charges which were imposed on the eve of Polokwane were thrown out of court by judge Nicholson who showed that Mbeki had interfered with the prosecution processes. On appeal Nicolson was overturned but then new NPA had drop charges coz of the spy tapes. Andile Mngxitama (@BlaqPerspective)

The Mbeki camp provided new impetus fo Billy Downer to deal with Zuma. They literally let the apartheid agents who had vendetta against Zuma to have a go at him. Vavi; Blade and Juju stood up against this open judicial lynching of #Zuma. Juju was prepared to kill for JZ. Andile Mngxitama (@BlaqPerspective)

Now the racist DA entered the matter ironically and in a manner that shows how desperate and conflicted Billy Downer is; he submitted a supporting affidavit to the DA application to review the Mpshe decision to withdraw charges. All this stuff going on since 2005. Andile Mngxitama (@BlaqPerspective)

With Stellenbosch victory in Nasrec Billy Downer was again given new lease of life to persue his historical vendetta against Zuma. This case is nothing but political persecution. #zuma added to his sins by launching the RET agenda. There was the coalescing of apartheid and wmc Andile Mngxitama (@BlaqPerspective)

Billy Downer’s case is based on a forensic report by the discredited KPMG. This audit firm was forced by Pravin Gordhan to fire 8 executives plus its CEO for having found that Gordhan had indeed set up an rogue unit at SARS. KPMG report corroborated 3 other investigations. Andile Mngxitama (@BlaqPerspective)
2020/05/19, 18:47
Pravin Gordhan just like he got the editor and senior investigative journalists at Sunday Times to be fired for reporting on the RogueUnit seem to have gotten KPMG to fire the executives. Then apologise to him and withdrew their forensic report ⁦‪@NoseweekM‬⁩ has detailed reports Andile Mngxitama (@BlaqPerspective)
2020/05/19, 18:47
The KPMG report on the rogue unit was undertaken by a team of about 30 led by Johan van der Walt (remember this name). Johann had been with KPMG for 22 years! He was fired with his the other execs under the false claim that they were involved with the Guptas. It was a cover up. Andile Mngxitama (@BlaqPerspective)
2020/05/19, 18:47
Curiously, the SA media never followed up on what happened to the 9 executives. What we know is that this van der Walt character joined a thing called FTI. And here is the most sinister part of Billy Downer’s anti Zuma vendetta. Seeing that KPMG is totally discredit Andile Mngxitama (@BlaqPerspective)

So determined is Billy Downer to down Zuma he has even together with the klipdrift and coke ravaged Johan van der Walt gone as far as dragging the name of Nelson Mandela into the mud. When they share koeksusters in honor of the Voortrekkers nothing will stand on their way. Andile Mngxitama (@BlaqPerspective)

Billy Downer is ridding on the Stellenbosch momentum and Thumamina hate against Zuma to settle a political score. Zuma is persecuted for fighting the apartheid regime and then founding RET which threatens the very existence of wmc. Stellenbosch and London want Zuma removed. Andile Mngxitama (@BlaqPerspective)

Billy Downer is not after justice. He is a committed soldier of those who stole our land. Johann van der walt is being roped in to fulfil the mission of Jan van Riebeeck.
(to be continued) This case against Zuma has been dragging on for some twenty years. Already the lengthy delay in finalizing the case; Zuma’s right to a speedy trial; the unfavorable public perception of Zuma brought about by the white owned institutions; political interference in that Thabo Mbeki and Justice Minister Maduna conspired to influence the NPA into unfairly prosecuting Zuma; and the partiality of the judiciary towards white monopoly capital (WMC), amongst other things, adversely affects Zuma’s right to a fair trial. “Zuma is unlikely to get the fair trial that he wants. The courts will ultimately defend WMC and rule against him. It’s a political battle. It’s not about justice. It’s about silencing radical economic transformation (RET) of which Zuma is the father,” Mngxitama told Black Opinion.
