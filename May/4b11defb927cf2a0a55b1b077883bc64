By Andile Mngxitama On 14 May 2020 Black First Land First (BLF) turned 4. To mark the occasion BLF says to the Ramaphosa government: “Instead of the Special Covid-19 Social Relief of Distress (SRD) Grant of R350, which translates to R2100 for a period of six months, give the unemployed 50% of the R500 billion stimulus package. In other words give the 5 million qualifying unemployed people a total of R50 000 each, which amounts to R 8 300 per month for six months.” The brainwashed say that we are mad. It’s too much. But they are fine with Members of Parliament (MPs) getting R90 000 a month which amounts to over one million per annum! We note that there are only two organizations making demands around the Covid-19 crisis to President Ramaphosa – the Democratic Alliance (DA) for the white side, and BLF for the black side. Ramaphosa concedes to all the demands of the white side. The black side is totally ignored. The rest of the political parties have surrendered to Ramaphosa. The DA is the de facto ideological leader of the parties in parliament. I went live yesterday to honor BLF for its achievements thus far. I also spoke about what the movement stands for and plans to continue building it into a formidable force. I further presented a concrete analysis of the state of politics in the country in the time of the Covid-19 crisis. Watch my address: https://www.facebook.com/andile.mngxi/videos/1673315822827259/ Happy Birthday to BLF, the only revolutionary Black Consciousness and Pan Afrikanist movement in occupied Azania. The future is BLACK! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
