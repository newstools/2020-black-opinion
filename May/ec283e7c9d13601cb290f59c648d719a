By Andile Mngxitama On Monday Vodacom switched on the first live 5G mobile network in Africa in three cities in South Africa (SA) namely, Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town. Further rollouts are scheduled in other areas of the country. Vodacom was recently allocated temporary spectrum for the lockdown period by the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA). The telecoms regulator is set to auction more spectrum, including 5G, by the end of 2020. Vodacom will be benefitting from the heightened online activity during the COVID-19 lockdown period. This entails big profits by the mobile operator from the 40% traffic increase in mobile network and the 250% traffic increase in fixed wireless network that the COVID-19 lockdown period is experiencing. In due course other mobile operators will also be benefiting. 5G is here! The roll out of 5G during the COVID-19 lockdown is foundational to its success even beyond the pandemic. Thereâ€™s mass legalised looting by white monopoly capital (WMC) and the serious potential health risks to both people and the environment have not been addressed. Through all of this politicians are hidding under the bed. What can we do to help ourselves? Yesterday, 4 May 2020, I went live on my Facebook page on the topic of 5G in SA and what must be done.
