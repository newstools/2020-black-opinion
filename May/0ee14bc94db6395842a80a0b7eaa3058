By Andile Mngxitama Over the 50 day period of the Covid-19 National lockdown in South Africa (SA) the Ramaphosa government has, amongst other things: i. begun unleashing 5G with no guarantees that the associated health and environmental risks have been addressed;
ii. endorsed Bill Gates vaccines;
iii. promised the unemployed just R350 per month for 6 months in terms of a Special Covid-19 Social Relief of Distress (SRD) Grant – a mere 2.1% of the R500 billion stimulus package;
iv. given R540 billion to the banks to grant loans (not relief) during the Covid-19 crisis;
v. given most of the R500 billion stimulus package to white monopoly capital (WMC);
vi. privatized the South African Airways (SAA) and Eskom; and
vii. given nothing to the 3 million informal sector traders. The lockdown started on 27 March 2020. Before that, on 18 March parliamentarians pledged their support to Ramaphosa by giving him the powers to serve those who made him president – the CR17 donors – under the guise of fighting Covid-19. Ramaphosa was bought at the ANC Nasrec conference of 2017 for R1 billion. We have witnessed the total take over of the economy by WMC via huge stimulus packages and nothing but crumbs for the poor. In the meanwhile, opposition parties continue to hide under the bed and pretend not to see. On 15 May 2020 I took stock of the Covid-19 crisis 50 days into the national lockdown – via a live broadcast on my Facebook page. I reflected on how the crisis is simultaneously sponsoring the agendas of unleashing Bill Gates vaccines; rolling out 5G technology; and securing economic monopoly and political control.
