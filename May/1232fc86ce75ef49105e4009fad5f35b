Guinea Bissau accepts shipment of Madagascar’s Covid-Organics By Andile Mngxitama The attack on Madagascar’s Covid-Organics by some morons continues. African morons and their moronic leaders are asking moronic questions about the Malagasy remedy for covid-19 infections. They want to use the amazing early interventions by countries like Rwanda to try and undermine the efficacy of the remedy. Self-hate and self-doubt is deep. Covid-Organics is an African remedy and it works. We congratulate Madagascar and call on the Stellenbosch controlled anti black government of South Africa (SA) to get the African remedy for use in this country. We know that it is waiting for whites to tell us that Covid-Organics is safe. Morons say that they want scientific evidence, in the face of such evidence. The same morons are allowing the roll-out of 5G technology all over the place without any evidence that it is safe. Studies of well over 320 experts, including scientists and medical doctors globally, warn of the potential dangerous health risks of 5G to both humans and the environment. How do morons think? Oh I forgot, they don’t … Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
