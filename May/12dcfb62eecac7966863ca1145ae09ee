By Andile Mngxitama Is it not interesting that almost all the South African (SA) liberation movements – (African National Congress (ANC), Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC), and Azanian Peoole’s Organization (AZAPO) – have abandoned or diluted indigenous ideologies and philosophies for what they call “scientific socialism”? The ANC was de facto driven by scientific socialism through being ideologically controlled by the South African Communist Party (SACP). The PAC adopted the scientific socialism framework as if Pan Afrikanism is not scientific and socialist. And as if Black Consciousness (BC) is not scientific and socialist, AZAPO too adopted scientific socialism as its ideological framework. People who take revolutionary theory seriously must study the implications of this abandonment of home grown ideological frameworks as central to our liberation efforts. It’s noteworthy that the adoption of scientific socialism by these movements have made them amenable to white membership. The ANC diluted its black nationalism, the PAC diluted its Pan Afrikanism, and AZAPO diluted its BC – all this because of the Marxist construct called “scientific socialism”. This is a provocation for people of theory and towards melding it with practice. Of course the Mazzotti people who adopted the rubric of Marxism-Leninism-Fanonism have long abandoned Frantz Fanon, even in rhetorical terms. We are Black Nationalist guided by BC as articulated by Steve Biko. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
