By Andile Mngxitama Yesterday (10 May 2020) we did a successful live launch via Zoom on Facebook of the 10th anniversary edition of the book BLACKS CAN’T BE RACIST (BCBR) which I wrote a decade ago. At the event I engaged in conversation with Athi Joja, Ziyana Lategan and Ndumiso Ubu-Dladla about the book and the trajectory of race discourse in South Africa (SA) since its first publication 10 years ago as volume 3 of the New Frank Talk series of essays on the black condition. Thanks to those who participated in the launch. I apologize sincerely for the late start. You may watch the full recorded version of the BCBR 10th anniversary launch which is in 2 parts: 1. https://www.facebook.com/BCBRBook/videos/237279237549554/ 2. https://www.facebook.com/BCBRBook/videos/569564493688516/ Order your copy of BCBR via WhatsApp, email or go to the the Facebook page, BLACKS CAN’T BE RACIST.
