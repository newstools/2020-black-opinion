By Andile Mngxitama How was Christianity introduced to South Africa (SA)? What was the purpose? In Blacks Can’t Be Racist I provide an historical account of how Christianity was introduced in SA as part of the colonial project that inaugurated a cultural genocide. Christianity and western education are the terrible twins colonialism. Tomorrow (24 May 2020) we debate these questions including the assertion of whether Christianity can be used for liberation (I hold this view). We also answer the question, were Sobukwe and Biko Christians? Join me tomorrow on the Blacks Can’t Be Racist Facebook page at 20:00. It’s a date. I will be engaging a panel of great minds, scholars, former Christians. It’s advisable that you get your own copy of Blacks Can’t Be Racist to be able to follow these debates better. My interest in matters of faith and belief are utilitarian. You can’t miss this one. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
