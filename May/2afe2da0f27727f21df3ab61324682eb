By Andile Mngxitama To mark Worker’s Day I did a live presentation earlier today on Marxism and blackness. Did you know that organized Marxism was brought to South Africa (SA) to promote white supremacy? Marxism is racist as a method and also as a practice. The slave to Marxism won’t tell you this. Three quotes are instructive on this topic, namely: “Let us assume that black people receive the value of Absence. This mode of being becomes existence manqué—existence gone wrong. Their mode of being becomes the being of the NO” – Lewis Gordoni “The biggest mistake the black world ever made was to assume that whoever opposed apartheid was an ally” – Steven Biko “When I first arrived in South Africa in 1989, I was a Marxist. Toward the end of 1996, two and one half years after Nelson Mandela came to power, I left not knowing what I was. This is not to say that I, like so many repentant Marxists had come around to what policy wonks and highly placed notables within the ANC National Executive Committee called for then, a so-called “mixed economy;” a phrase that explained less than nothing but was catchy and saturated with common sense, thus making it unassailable” – Frank B. Wilderson, III There’s no such thing as a white worker. The only worker is the black worker. We aren’t Marxist but we are not anti Marxist. We are Black Consciousness. We have found Marx inadequate on the black problematic. Class as a Marxist tool of analysis, indicates the workings of capitalism and identifies the proletariat as the social strata that will destroy capitalism and usher in a socialist society. Ironically class serves as the most effective means of hiding race oppression in racist and colonial societies.
