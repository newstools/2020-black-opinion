Did you know? In 1998, Bill Clinton ordered the bombing of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory, which he claimed was producing VX nerve gas for Al-Qaeda. Later, officials admitted there was no proof of this, or any proof linking the factory to Osama Bin Laden. The bombing took place 1 week after the Monica Lewinsky scandal. The plant provided 50% of Sudanâ€™s medicine. Its destruction meant there were no supplies of chloroquine, the treatment for Malaria. The German ambassador to #Sudan attributed thousands of deaths to the medicine shortages caused by the destruction of the factory. #BillClinton #History Reposted from Going Underground No related posts.
