President Cyril Ramaphosa The government with the support of political parties in Parliament is giving the poor R350 each over six months. This comes to two thousand and one hundred (R2 100) in total. It’s an insult. The government has decided to shamelessly give 2.1% of the R500 billion Covid-19 support package to the unemployed. Black First Land First (BLF) demands that the poor be given a minimum of 20% up to a maximum of 50% of the relief fund. There is no clarity on what basis the government decided to give the unemployed just R350 per month for six months. It makes no sense. BLF believes that a minimum of 5 million of the 10 million unemployed people in South Africa (SA) would qualify for the Special COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress (SRD) Grant of R350. This means that when 20% of R500 billion is divided amongst 5 million unemployed people each person will get a total of twenty thousand rand (R20 000)
for 6 months. This amounts to 5 million unemployed people each getting R3 300 (three thousands and three hundred rand) per month for six months. Moreover should 50% of R500 billion be divided amongst 5 million unemployed people, each person will get a total of fifty thousand rand (R50 000) for 6 months. This translates to 5 million unemployed people each getting R 8 300 (eight thousand three hundred rand) per month for six months. There is accordingly no reason whatsoever why government is not giving the poor real relief. The money is there. Members of Parliament earn R1,137,933 a year. That’s over one million per annum! They however choose to give the poor a total of R2100 for a period of six months. They don’t respect their voters. BLF asks President Ramaphosa to urgently allocate 20 to 50 percent of the R500 billion for the relief of the poor. It can be done. We ask the President and Mr Julius Malema if they can live on R350 a month?
