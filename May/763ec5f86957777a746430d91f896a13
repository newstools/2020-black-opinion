Former South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson, Ms Dudu Myeni By Andile Mngxitama The people who were “multiplying” Winnie Mandela with beautiful doeks, seem not to see that another strong black woman is under attack from the same people who sought to destroy our icon Winnie. The open lynching of Dudu Myeni by white racists in “civil society” and the judiciary is a call to the front by people who care for black liberation. The silence strikes me as yet another betrayal. The indifference is a political choice. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
