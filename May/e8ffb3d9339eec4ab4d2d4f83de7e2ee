By Andile Mngxitama The government is not serious about the Special Covid-19 Social Relief of Distress (SRD) Grant of R350 which it undertook to pay the poor monthly for six months. Besides the promised R350 Grant, which It constitutes just 2% of the Covid-19 R500 billion stimulus package, is an insult. Who gets the 98%? To date only 10 people have been paid out of 5 million applicants. Letâ€™s note: 1. The R350 is a meager 2% of the R500 billion.
2. BLF had asked for 50% of the R500 billion stimulus package to go to the poor. This gives 5 million people a total of R50 000 each for six months.
3. We now ask for 10% of the R500 billion. That will give the 5 million people a total of R10 000 each for six months translating to each getting R1600 per month. Can we work with this? Our people deserve better!!! On 22 May 2020, I went live on Facebook on how the government is not serious about the SRD Grant of R350. Watch my full reflection: https://www.facebook.com/andile.mngxi/videos/1680497448775763/ Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
