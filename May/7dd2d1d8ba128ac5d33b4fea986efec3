Black First Land First (BLF) condemns the racist murder of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, by the Minneapolis Police Department. We salute the righteous indignation and resistance of the thousands of Minneapolis people who are demanding justice for George Floyd in the face of violent state repression through paramilitary police brutality. The state-sanctioned killing of George Floyd follows numerous other police murders of blacks that have occurred since the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States (US). We note how the cop Darren Wilson got away with executing Mike Brown; and the police officer Daniel Pantaleo got away with killing Eric Garner in a chokehold. To this end the US allows and even rewards the genocide of blacks. It is further instructive that in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis and while lockdown measures are in place in the rest of the US, the lynching of Black people has in fact intensified in the black communities. Our condolences to the family and community of George Floyd. We join the voices of the Minneapolis community and all other progressive forces in calling for: 1. the immediate arrest, charging and prosecution of Derek Chauvin and the three other police officers.
2. the ending of the repression of the Minneapolis protesters demanding justice for George Floyd
3. accountability for the killings of blacks during the Covid-19 crisis. Justice for George Floyd and all victims of state repression now! Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC)
