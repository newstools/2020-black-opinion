Flag of Venezuela Black First Land First (BLF) strongly condemns the attempted terrorist incursion on May 3 into Venezuela from Colombia. We further applaud the Bolivarian security forces for successfully disarticulating the United States (US) sponsored Columbian attack which included a plan to assassinate government officials, spread violence in the country, and remove the Maduro administration from power. The US should address the COVID-19 crisis which makes it the epicenter of the pandemic, rather than orchestrating cowardly imperialist invasions of Venezuela and other progressive countries. BLF calls on the Chavista people to continue the fight for its sovereignty and independence. We extend our internationalist solidarity to you and President Maduro.
