By Andile Mngxitama Only those who are serious about revolutionary change and confronting the real enemy, know that one ought to defend Jacob Zuma and expose the enemy, which is white monopoly capital (WMC), and its agents. Zuma is not a saint. He is our symbol against the enemy. He took a stand. That’s why he had to go. And they are still after him because they don’t trust that he won’t raise the masses against them. One day we must talk about these people who claim to be Black Consciousness (BC) or Pan Afrikanist but hate Zuma more than they hate land thieves. These people continually repeat stock phrases with total disregard for the actual battle between Zuma (via radical economic transformation) and the entire white establishment. Their hate for Zuma makes them de facto agents of the enemy. You can’t be neutral in the middle of a battle between a black person and land thieves – worse still (as is the case here), busy attacking Zuma while the enemy is doing the same. These are agents of whiteness wittingly or otherwise. One day we shall talk about them. They are no different from the likes of Save S.A.
