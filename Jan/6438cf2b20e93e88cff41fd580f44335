Image credit: fewzion By Andile Mngxitama Planning is key. But one ought to internalize one’s vision because as the great Mike Tyson said, “Everyone Has a Plan Until They Get Punched in the Mouth”. Tyson elaborates: “People were asking me [prior to a fight], ‘What’s going to happen?,’ … They were talking about his style. ‘He’s going to give you a lot of lateral movement. He’s going to move, he’s going to dance. He’s going to do this, do that.’ I said, “Everybody has a plan until they get hit. Then, like a rat, they stop in fear and freeze.’ ” My favorite Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fights are when both fighters have similar skill levels and endurance. In the “championship rounds”, both fighters are tired and battered. No plan applies here. They are fighting with their 6th sense. We need that extra instinct to take us to the black truth towards black liberation. We need it if we are going to get where we must go… 2020, Year of Awakening & Organizing!
