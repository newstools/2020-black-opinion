Image credit: Richard Maponya Facebook Page By Andile Mngxitama Richard Maponya, a pioneer, path finder and genius black businessman passed away this morning, at the age of 99, following a brief illness. We, as a people, must recognize his genuis and honor him. We must learn from him.
From his personal success we must recognize that blacks can’t really change their circumstances through individual effort. We need a political order which puts blacks first. Maponya should have been bigger than the Oppenheimers if we had a state which did what the apartheid state did for white business. He was supposed to be the shield to bring down white monopoly capital (WMC) – a proper leader of the patriotic black bourgeoisie. There can be no real business success and independence without political independence driving economic independence. The current apartheid structure of the economy, creates economic askaris like Cyril Ramaphosa and suffocates black business efforts. We learn from the example of the great Richard Maponya that we remain unfree. Just check the Maponya Mall: Who is making money from our people? Who owns the profits? The late great Richard Maponya has made his unmatched contribution. We must learn from him and liberate the township economies. We must take the fight to WMC in order to free black business and bring about economic liberation for all our people. RIP, giant of occupied Azania… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
