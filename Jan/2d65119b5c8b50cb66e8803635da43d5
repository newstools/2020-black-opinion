By Andile Mngxitama Here are the white people who paid R1 billion to buy the African National Congress (ANC) elective conference in 2017 to secure a State President who will serve their interests.  All of you who voted for the ANC actually voted for these people. You put them in power through their proxy, Cyril Ramaphosa. Black First Land First (BLF) did warn you though. My YouTube channel ‘The Black Perspective’ will be dealing with this issue under the theme “UNMASKING THE REAL ANC TODAY”. The first episode is coming up this week in two parts.
