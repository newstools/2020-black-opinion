Image credit: medium.com By Andile Mngxitama Some nations are blessed with national heroes, like Iran is with the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC) Quds Force, Major-General Qassem Soleimani, who was assassinated last week in Baghdad by the war mongering imperialist United States (U.S.). Soleimani is a martyr of the oppressed people all over the world. His unwavering commitment to his people and his country inspires us to fight to the end by any means necessary. He epitomizes the spirit of “Land or Death”. South Africa (SA) on the other hand is cursed with Louis Vuitton and profit addicted puppets who will serve the interests of white monopoly capital (WMC) at any cost. Cyril Ramaphosa we know is a bought man. WMC paid R1 billion to buy themselves the President of SA via the ANC Nasrec conference. The SA comprador is clearly too compromised to lead the struggle against WMC and colonialism. Take the leaders of the Economic Freedom Fighters, Julius Malema and Floyd Shivambu, they steal from the poor and eat their money. Their best contribution is taking the EFF into coalitions with the Democratic Alliance (DA). They joined StratCom and settler WMC against President Zuma, to remove him from power and thereby undermine his Radical Economic Transformation (RET) agenda. They are moreover properly managed by WMC that has all their files to hold them at ransom with threats of revelations and jail. That’s why they won’t challenge Cyril Ramaphosa in parliament. That’s also why there will not be any meaningful action for land expropriation without compensation. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
