By BO Staff Writer Andile Mngxitama, the President of Black First Land First (BLF) which is a radical black consciousness organization, has unveiled plans to launch a YouTube channel in January 2020. “It’s part of my contribution to the year of Awakening and Organizing declared by BLF”, he told Black Opinion. “The immediate threat to achieving Radical Economic Transformation was the imposed ignorance by white propaganda”, Mngxitama said further. “The YouTube channel will be called ‘The Black Perspective’. It seeks to counter the dominant white perspective which systematically makes black people stupid even if they speak good English”, he expounded. Mngxitama seeks to tackle big questions such as the role of white monopoly capital (WMC) in state capture; and how State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) are being deliberately run down to justify their privatization. The channel will be fact based, according to Mngxitama. “A promo will be released by this weekend. The first episode is to tackle the thorny issue of how the ANC and EFF have sold out the mandate of land expropriation without compensation”, Mngxitama elaborated. No related posts.
