Image credit: rediff.com BLF welcomes the picket action being undertaken today at Eskom’s Megawatt Park in Joburg by the National Union of Metal Workers of SA (Numsa) and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). We support without reservation the principled call by Numsa and NUM for Pravin Gordhan to go. We further support their opposition to the privatization of Eskom and their objection to the appointment of the pro white monopoly capital (WMC) Andre de Ruyter as the new CEO of Eskom. On 13 January, Black First Land First (BLF) launched the ‘Stop Loadshedding! Pravin Gordhan Must Go!‘ petition. We in addition called on Cyril Ramaphosa to bring back the competent and tested South Africans who can end loadshedding again, namely Dr Ben Ngubane; Brain Molefe; and Matshela Koko. Over 2000 people have signed the petition thus far and the target is 10 000 signatures. The direct action by Numsa and NUM as well as the campaign currently being conducted by BLF suggests that there is certainly growing national consensus that Pravin Gordhan Must Go for loadshedding to end. BLF calls on all organizations, interest groups, individuals and other progressive entities to support the call “Pravin Gordhan Must Go”.
