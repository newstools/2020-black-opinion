By Andile Mngxitama Finally here’s #TheBlackPerspective Episode 1, Part 1 which deals with explaining the hoax of Land Expropriation Without Compensation – see link below. It’s the first installment of a two part episode. I break down the lie about land expropriation and give you the history of it and some interesting footage you may have never seen before. I’m still shocked by what Julius Malema said to land thieves in April 2015. Part 2, which will be released this Friday, deals with Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi’s submissions that amending Section 25 isn’t necessary, amongst other things. In Episode 2, which we release next week, we break down completely the video that was taken in 2015 when Julius Malema met the land thieves of Paarl to allay their fears about land expropriation after the EFF takes power. Do subscribe to my YouTube channel “The Black Perspective”. Stay tuned and share. Educate yourself and also give your critical feedback so that we may improve.
