Image credit: search67.com By BO Staff Writer President of the African National Congress (ANC) Cyril Ramaphosa was out of the public view for the whole day on Friday. He cancelled all pre announced engagements for the day, including participating in a benefit golf tournament. This follows the big revelation by the Deputy President DD Mabuza that the Eskom board and Pravin Gordhan lied to him about loadsheding. Ramaphosa reappeared in public only on Friday evening when he announced that the Chairman of the Eskom board has resigned. This has raised a lot questions. There is a groundswell of calls for Ramaphosa to fire Pravin Gordhan. It seems like the former Eskom Chair, Jabu Mabuza, was made a sacrificial lamb to save Gordhan. Ramaphosa seems to have been put in a corner by white monopoly capital (WMC) which is using Gordhan to deepen the energy crisis so as to justify privatization. No related posts.
