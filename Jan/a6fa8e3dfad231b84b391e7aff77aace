By Andile Mngxitama University experience must be total. A university that bans alcohol on campus is nothing but a glorified high school. They must also ban all the religious clubs and stuff. This banning order endangers lives of students who will go off campus to get their drinks. I lived in a RES with a bar. It was super. Then I lived in one without a bar. My friend Ike Hloka was robbed almost every weekend because he was that brave. Thing is, he would knock at my door at 4 AM barefooted like Jesus Christ and challenge me to show my loyalty to our friendship by going back to where he was robbed to teach those thugs a lesson. My response was always swift “ike tsamo robala morwa”. He would then stagger off in protest mouthing some big english words like; “you will adumbrate this lacuna in your loyalty; this is travesty of justice…” White universities stopped bars when blacks came there. At Wits there was a 24/7 drinking debauchery at a racist thing called RAG. Some blacks joined for free booze. It was right on the main campus. Anyway I know it may sound insensitive to talk about the right to drink when we are facing a fees crisis, but please can universities not be High Schools? I should add, a pub on campus doesn’t mean everyone is going to be a drinker. Just like having religious clubs at university doesn’t mean everyone is going to be a religious freak. My other friend Jacob Tshabangu didn’t drink but hanged with us to discuss Marx and theory.
