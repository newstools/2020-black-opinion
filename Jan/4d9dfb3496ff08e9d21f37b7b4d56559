By Andile Mngxitama “Enlightenment is a destructive process. It has nothing to do with becoming better or being happier. Enlightenment is the crumbling away of untruth. It’s seeing through the facade of pretense. It’s the complete eradication of everything we imagined to be true.” ― Adyashanti In this year of Awakening and Organizing, we are going to touch on subjects which invoke rage and indignation. You are going to be deeply shocked. Your views will be totally interrogated and opposed. But that’s part of coming to Black Consciousness. Prepare yourself to considerably change your views. I too remain open to be educated and to improve my understanding so that I may be a better teacher for black liberation. Please note that critical thinking is not a popularity contest. it’s a search for the black truth so that we may develop better ways to think and to act towards realizing the sole purpose of black liberation. Some of the most difficult and sensitive topics are intra black, such as culture and religion.
Once you have seen the way, you can’t unsee. It’s the burden of knowing…. 2020, Year of Awakening & Organizing! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
