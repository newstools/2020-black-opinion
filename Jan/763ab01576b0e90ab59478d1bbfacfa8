ANC 108 birthday celebrations in Kimberley, Northern Cape . Image credit: via Twitter: @LukhonaMnguni By Andile Mngxitama I believe that the African National Congress (ANC) spent close to R50 million to host its 108th birthday rally on 11 January at the Tafel Lager Park Stadium, in Kimberley, in the Northern Cape. In fact they could easily have given each person there R10k. Rallies are also used to launder money. Party bosses enter into all kinds of kick back agreements with service providers on inflated prices. That’s how party bosses loot the parliamentary allocations. If your party has rallies now and then, just know it’s pay time for your party bosses. To keep the people happy, they bring big artists for free entertainment. It’s the same old story of the Roman emperors and the circus. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
