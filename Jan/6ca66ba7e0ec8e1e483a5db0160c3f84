Image credit: Andile Mngxi Facebook Page By BO Staff Writer Andile Mngxitama, the President of the black consciousness organization, Black First Land First (BLF), has just released the promo for his YouTube channel “The Black Perspective”. “The Black Perspective seeks to counter the dominant white perspective which systematically makes black people stupid even if they speak good English. It is part of my contribution to the year of Awakening and Organizing declared by BLF”, he told Black Opinion, earlier this week. All are invited to subscribe to The Black Perspective. According to Mngxitama the first episode, which is expected shortly, will deal with “the thorny issue of how the ANC and EFF have sold out”.
