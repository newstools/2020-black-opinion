Photo credit: Bahnfrend via Wikimedia Black First Land First (BLF) denounces the sale by the South African Airways (SAA) of the Airbus A340-300s, A340-600s and 15 spare engines. We are not surprised by the sale of the assets of SAA. When Cyril Ramaphosa placed the SAA under business rescue last month, he did so at the behest of white monopoly capital (WMC) who spent R1 billion to bribe the ANC Nasrec conference so as to secure his position as president of the country. Ramaphosa is the preferred candidate of WMC in cahoots with imperialism. Now he is delivering the country to his sponsors. BLF reiterates that those who voted for Ramaphosa voted for the dishing out of state assets to WMC and its agents. We maintain that after WMC has finished with the SAA they will seize Eskom. BLF calls on all the progressive forces to hold an urgent national meeting towards stopping privatization in defence of state assets.
