The public broadcaster did not indicate any reason for Thabane’s resignation. However according to the BBC, the PM’s resignation has been demanded by both the ruling and opposition parties. According to a government’s spokesperson, the Lesotho police are looking for Maesaiah Thabane, the PM’s current wife, to question her about the 2017 murder of Lipolelo Thabane, the PM’s estranged wife. An arrest warrant is apparently out in this respect. Lipolelo Thabane was killed two days prior to the inauguration of the current PM. Both Maesaiah and Lipolelo were apparently stuck in litigation about who should assume the position of first lady. At his swearing in ceremony in June 2017, Thabane described the killing as “senseless”. Around the time of her killing, Lipolelo and the PM were allegedly involved in divorce proceedings.
