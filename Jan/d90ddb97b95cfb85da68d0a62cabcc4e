Photo credit: Lefty Shivambu / Gallo Images By Andile Mngxitama My beloved brother Pitso Mosimane can’t have it both ways. He is correct to launch a decolonial assault on the two Germans. But he can’t turn around and disrespect the indigenous forms of play. Is my brother looking down upon such great inventions such as aboTsamaya, spytwo and show me your number etc? Was Pitso trained in Europe for his coaching qualifications? It doesn’t matter. We shall have a one on one over flowing tears. It’s a bit disappointing really that he picked on that. I remember how Orlando Pirates bamboozled Tottenham Hotspur with Steve Lekoelea doing witchcraft on the pitch. The English left South Africa (SA) humbled. I hope Pitso has reasons for his beef with local flair. You want people to come back to the stadiums? Stop the European kick and run flairless play. Remember the “shoeshine and piano” style? Yes, we must remind our brother. Tears can interfere with thinking. I remain the No1 fan of my brother, the cryist of Tshwane.
