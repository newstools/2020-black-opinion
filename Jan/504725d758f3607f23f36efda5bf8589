Photo credit: 2oceansvibe.com The revealation today by the Deputy President, DD Mabuza, that Cyril Ramaphosa has been misled by the Board of Eskom about loadsheding, directly implicates Pravin Gordhan. Gordhan, the Minister of Public Enterprises who is responsible for Eskom, has facilitated these lies and appointed a clearly incompetent board to precipitate the energy crisis in the country. It is clear that under Gordhan there is no chance for loadsheding to end. There seems to be a conspiracy against the people of South Africa (SA) to cause an energy crisis in order to privatise Eskom. It is known that Gordhan is a conflicted Minister by virtue of his shareholding networks. This time he has gone too far and must be stopped. Black First Land First (BLF) calls on Ramaphosa to recall Gordhan with immediate effect; as well as dissolve the clueless Eskom Board and replace it with competent people like Dr Ngubane and proven sector leaders like Brian Molefe and Matshela Koko. If Ramaphosa doesnâ€™t act on this, then he himself will be considered to be part of the conspiracy against the people. BLF will start a petition calling for the removal of Gordhan. There will also be further direct peaceful actions to end the deliberately created energy crisis in SA. #GordhanMustGo Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC) 9 January 2019 Contact Details Black First Land First Mail: blackfirstlandfirst@gmail.com Zanele Lwana
