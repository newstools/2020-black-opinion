By Andile Mngxitama You aren’t going to insult black people out of the Christian church just because you are woke and they are not. People are not poor because of religion. They are religious because of poverty. Until you understand the basis of spiritual want, you will continue to think that people are stupid for believing. People will be religious as long as there is suffering. What we need to do is to find ways to use our people’s belief in God to help us fight for liberation. That’s why Steve Biko introduced Black Theology. I’m going to church on Sunday… Amen! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
