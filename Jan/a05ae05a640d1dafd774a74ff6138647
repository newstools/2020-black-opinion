Two hashtags are reportedly trending on social media, namely: #BolsonaroFicaCalado (meaning Bolsonaro, keep quiet); and #BolsonaroFicaQuieto (which means Bolsonaro, stay still). The vast majority of publications in Brazil feature memes that suggest worry about the reaction of the pro Trump Bolsonaro. The incident concerning the attack in Baghdad has escalated tensions between the US and the Middle East. To this end there are wide speculations about what the consequences will be. Ali Hoseiní Khameneí, Iran’s supreme leader, has vowed to take revenge. Donald Trump, on his part, went on twitter to try to clarify the actions in Baghdad. He accused Tehran of gaining systematic control of Iraq in the last 15 years. “The people of Iraq do not want to be dominated and controlled by Iran, but ultimately this is their choice. Over the past 15 years, Iran has gained more and more control over Iraq and the people of Iraq are not happy with this. This will never end well! “, Trump tweeted. In the meantime, Brazilians expressed their fear (on the internet) concerning the imminent reaction of their president regarding the US attack in Iraq. Their fears are legitimate considering Bolsonaro’s closeness to (and admiration of) his US counterpart, Trump. Thus far Bolsonaro has warned of the possible complications that the US attack could have on the fuel market in Brazil. He is reportedly scheduled to meet with Augusto Heleno, the Minister of Institutional Security, to deal with the issue. No related posts.
