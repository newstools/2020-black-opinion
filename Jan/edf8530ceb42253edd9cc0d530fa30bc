Pravin Gordhan. Image credit: BizNews Black First Land First (BLF) is pleased to announce that we have met our targer for day 2 of the “Stop Loadshedding, Pravin Gordhan Must Go” online petition. The petition aims to obtain 10 000 signatures to send a clear message to the President of South Africa (SA), Cyril Ramaphosa, to fire Gordhan. We are pleased by the positive response to our petition. It shows that there is national consensus that Gordhan must go. We are also pleased that two related hashtags have been trending on Twitter namely, #PravinMustGoNow and #PravinMustGo.
