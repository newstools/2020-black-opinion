Image credit: Aljezeera By BO Staff Writer The Iraqi Armed Forces has announced via its official Twitter account that the country’s Al-Balad Airbase, which is based in the Salah Al-Deen Province, has been hit by 8 Katyusha rockets which has left 4 Iraqi Air Force members injured. It is said that the attack has raised a number of questions due to its timing and the presence at the Airbase of U.S. advisers, trainers, and a company that renders maintenance in respect of the F-16 aircraft. The attack follows days after 22 missiles were fired by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards at 2 Iraqi military bases where U.S. troops have been deployed. 17 of the 22 missiles that were fired, targeted Iraq’s Ain Al-Assad Base which is based in the country’s Al-Anbar Province. This Iranian attack in turn came days after the U.S. assassination of Qassem Soleimani (the commander of the Quds Force), and Abu Mahdi Al-Mohandes (Deputy Head of the Popular Mobilization Forces). U.S. President Donald Trump has responded with the imposition of new sanctions against Iran. Thus far no one has claimed responsibility for the attack on the Al-Balad Airbase. No related posts.
