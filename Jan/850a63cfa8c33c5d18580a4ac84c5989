By Andile Mngxitama I like how some African National Congress (ANC) comrades honestly think that this whole thing of blackism is a bit of a joke or madness. The Mazzotti boys think that black consciousness (BC) is dirt. So they talk to me like I’m some oddity; like I’m some mad family member. They say, “you mad because you going to tell parents that they are fucked up. Thina we can’t because mchana we are mos normal. We push non racialism”. There are however many others who genuinely support what we do and admit that the ANC won’t address the black condition. There is one person who is open about the fact that outside he is ANC but inside he is Black First Land First (BLF). I always tell them that we are coming to apply for alliance status with the ANC and the first thing we shall do is moer Derek Hanekom. You must see their eyes pop. Lol, I dig them ANC brothers and sisters. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
