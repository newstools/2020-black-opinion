Image credit: Iraqi Prime Minister Press Office via AP By BO Staff Writer A spine-chilling video of American terrorism has been leaked that allegedly captures the moment, at Baghdad airport, that the Iranian Major-General Qassem Soleimani and his comrades were killed by the US airstrike The images of the indiscriminate attacks and shelling, as well as the drone strike of the convoy allegedly used by the martyred Soleimani – is nothing but sheer terrorism. It’s a cowardly act that must be condemned by all sane people. If the intention of the Pentagon was to intimidate Iran by leaking the video, then it has backfired badly. The world is indignant and outraged by Donald Trump’s barbaric behavior.
