Jonathan and Nicky Oppenheimer. Image credit: Tatler By BO Staff Writer The secretive Oppenheimers are the biggest beneficiaries of Jacob Zuma’s removal from power. They have made over R6 billion from a mere R10 million investment. The powerful family had contributed R10 million to the CR17 campaign to buy the African National Congress (ANC) elective conference that was held in Nasrec in December 2017. The return on investment has been phenomenal for the Oppenheimers. They made R6 billion in one year! Johann Rupert the kingpin in the removal of Zuma, made R11 billion also one year. Whilst unemployment and poverty are increasing under Cyril Ramaphosa’s presidency, his benefactors have made super profits in just one year. Black businesses have also been suffering since Ramaphosa took office. The next target of the CR17 benefactors is Eskom, which they want privatized for themselves. Already Ramaphosa has given them a R1.4 trillion gift in the form of Independent Power Producers (IPPs). The Oppenheimers and Rupert are the main drivers of inequality in South Africa. Together they have the wealth equivalent to the combined wealth of over 25 million South Africans. Under Ramaphosa the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer! No related posts.
