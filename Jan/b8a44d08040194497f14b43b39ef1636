The University of Cape Town. Image credit: BizNews By BO Staff Writer Professor of Mathematics Education and Vice-Chancellor at the University of Cape Town (UCT), Mamokgethi Phakeng, has reportedly pointed out the worth of studying at UCT in comparison to other universities. She was being interviewed by Cape Talk’s Kieno Kammies. She also elaborated on the university’s “d-school” as well as its “Foundation Programme in Design Thinking”. ”If you study at UCT you study at a university in the top-100 in the world in terms of graduate employability… 80% of our students are employed at the time of graduation… Our graduates are sought-after. If you come to UCT you’re setting yourself up for success…” she said Moreover, “[t]here’s an opportunity to build networks for life [should you be selected to study at UCT] … an institution that’ll back you for the rest of your career…”, she pointed out. Black First Land First (BLF) President, Andile Mngxitama, is not surprised that the employment of 80% of UCT graduates is secured. “The colonial administration established the university alongside the church and police station. Its job was to train colonial junior administrators. Fort Hare trained most of the first generation university educated natives. Most went on to serve the settler colonial establishment. A few rebelled. But that’s the function of the university. UCT, and other liberal universities, are seen as the best trainers of servants of the system”, Mngxitama said. Furthermore, “the apartheid homeland system also produced a network of universities to train Bantustan administrators. The problem is that post 1994, South Africa (SA) has recognized the white university like UCT, because it is white monopoly capital dominated. If you received your papers from Unitra, you will go back to stand in line in the queue”, he clarified. No related posts.
