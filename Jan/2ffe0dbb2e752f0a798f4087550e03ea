By Andile Mngxitama Did you know that every year people go the town of Davos in the Swiss Alps to attend the World Economic Forum (WEF) where they discuss how to end poverty with its creators? They say they have a common agenda with the world’s wealthiest to end poverty. Think about it – those who create poverty to make profits, sponsor the whole thing. Today marks the 50th anniversary of this ritual. In 2005 I wrote a piece that was published in Pambazuka News. It’s an introduction to the politics of Davos and WEF, and its counter World Social Forum (WSF). Most of us, young lefties of the time, did the annual pilgrimage to Porto Alegre this time of the year. I did maybe two stints. Take the time. Read my contribution at your pleasure. It’s titled, ”WSF: The colonisation of resistance?” You may access it via the link, https://www.pambazuka.org/governance/wsf-colonisation-resistance?fbclid=IwAR1qJLmyCKmuvBjP4JptrtyIOzXxATeOm9FqB1rz6GsJEZqUGTkL7lL24qk Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
