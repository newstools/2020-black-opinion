Image Credit: Reuters By BO Staff Writer World War lll trends globally on social media following the US assassination on 3 January of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad. While many, including leaders and experts, are shocked and see the future as unpredictable, many have taken to social media to express their concern that Trump’s attack on Baghdad and his execution of Soleimani will lead to World War III. In this context, Ali Khamenei, who is Iran’s supreme leader, has vowed to unleash ‘crushing revenge’, ‘harsh vengeance’, and ‘jihad’ in response to the cowardly US actions. After the attack was executed, the trigger happy US president, Donald Trump, publicly gloated. He posted an image of the American flag and tweeted the message “Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!” Iran’s leader Ayatollah Khomeinei tweeted that the responsible ‘criminals’ had ‘his (Soleimani’s) and other martyrs’ blood on their evil hands’. ‘God willing, his work and his path will not be stopped’, Khomeinei prayed. According to experts who featured on the BBC’s ‘Today programme‘, the reaction of Iran has been “extraordinary”. They further alluded to high-level interventions entailing “very severe revenge” with unknown consequences. While many have mocked the notion of the outbreak of world war 3, there is nonetheless serious concern about the adverse consequences of the attack. No related posts.
