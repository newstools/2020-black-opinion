On Sunday, Jan. 12, during a meeting for the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) in Argentina, ousted Bolivian President Evo Morales suggested forming armed militias in defense of the people. This, amid rampant state violence under Bolivia’s fascist government, which forcibly took power in November 2019. Indigenous people, especially women and members of MAS, are still under attack. “If I return (to Bolivia) … we must organize, like in Venezuela, armed militias of the people,” Evo said, according to HispanTV, citing audio from Radio Kawsachun Coca del Chapare.
