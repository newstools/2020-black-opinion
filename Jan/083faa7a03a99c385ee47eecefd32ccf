Photo credit: Aljazeera Black First Land First (BLF) condems the terrorist attack on the people of Iran by the war mongering imperialist United States of America (USA). The assassination of the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corpsâ€™ (IRGC) Quds Force, Major-General Qassem Soleimani, is nothing but a declaration of war, a scare tactic. BLF regards Soleimani as a global martyr of all the oppressed people of the world. We are inspired by his commitment to fight to the end and spare nothing in the quest for the liberation of his people. BLF draws inspiration from his dedication to his motherland and his people. Soleimani embodies the essence of the spirit of Land or Death! His death in the battlefield, is the death that all revolutionaries aspire for. Nothing is higher service than such sacrifice to the liberation of the people. We salute a fine soldier for peace and justice. #DownWithImperialism
