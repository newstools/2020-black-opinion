Does American Twitter come to a stand still when a South African sportsman has died??? Umbuzo nje,” she tweeted. Bryant, the United States of America (USA) N.B.A. star, died with 8 others, including his daughter Gianna who was 13 years of age, in an air crash on Sunday. In response to Mazwai’s utterance on Twitter Andile Mngxitama, the President of Black First Land First (BLF), took to social media: “Sister Ntsiki Mazwai must never be censored. We must protect her against the insultists. She must have free reign to criticize all and we must equally engage her and call her out. It’s healthy for the revolutionary process. I do think that her take on black Americans is mistaken. Black Americans are not the USA. They are victims of the USA, like all of us. One ought to think of blacks out of the continent as brothers and sisters who are from Afrika but dislocated from home by the evil white system”, Mngxitama said. “One ought to think of Kobi as a brother from Zola or Mamelodi. We have to get our Black Consciousness right, and also our Pan Afrikanism can’t be parochial”, he implored.
