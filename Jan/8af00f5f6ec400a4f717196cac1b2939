By Andile Mngxitama Dear all, there are some people who continue to insult me for my piece “It’s Mandela Guys!”. I ask anyone to provide me with solid evidence if your answer to the following question is yes: Is there any evidence that Robert Sobukwe and Steve Biko ever underwent military training? Yhuuu the gun freaks are too fragile shem. I’m a Bikoist. I’m not afraid of the truth. We know that Nelson Mandela underwent military training. This is a fact! Steve Biko never underwent military training. In fact, in 1972 he opposed the motion in the Black People’s Convention (BPC) for armed struggle. He did so for good tactical reasons. Then around 1976 he planned to move in the direction of armed struggle, again for good reasons. But I’m not going to lie because some people hate Mandela that much that they refuse to admit that he underwent military training while Biko and Sobukwe did not. I’m tired of foul mouthed imbeciles. I don’t just speak, I investigate before I do so. It doesn’t mean that Biko is any less than Madiba just because he didn’t do military training. Lol people, stop being so fragile. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
