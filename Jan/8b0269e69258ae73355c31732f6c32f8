The Black Perspective seeks to counter the dominant white perspective which systematically makes black people stupid even if they speak good English. It is part of my contribution to the year of Awakening and Organizing declared by BLF”, he told Black Opinion. In response to the white monopoly capital (WMC) controlled poll by Times LIVE, Mngxitama said: “They are scared. Let’s beat them on their own poll. Let’s vote! Share in your walls tell others to do the same. ITS ON!” The Times Live Poll may be accessed via the link, https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2020-01-09-poll–blf-president-andile-mngxitama-launches-youtube-channel–will-you-tune-in/?fbclid=IwAR2qCAJUyH7w3YoW0YmNeXz1D3T7Ou9c7MSd9QEOtkCZEoNpU_ltpK7J04E No related posts.
