Pravin Gordhan. Picture credit: REUTERS By BO Staff Writer Black First Land First (BLF) has today launched an online petition to stop loadshedding by firing Pravin Gordhan. The petition reads as follows: “Loadshedding has become normalised and is likely to get severe around winter with the high demand. Pravin Gordhan, who is the Minister of Public Enterprises, has appointed an incompetent board and CEO at Eskom. The crisis around Eskom has led to Minister Gordhan misleading the State President. Loadshedding is a tactic used to terrorize the nation into accepting privatization. Loadshedding can be stopped but Minister Gordhan cannot lead such a process because he is conflicted. For loadshedding to end, Pravin Gordhan must go. There are competent and tested South Africans who can end loadshedding again, namely Dr Ben Ngubane; Brain Molefe; and Matshela Koko, but they won’t be asked to come and rescue Eskom because Gordhan considers these patriots as his opponents. The consequence of it all is the continued loadshedding by misleading the President and the nation. Let’s all tell President Ramaphosa that enough is enough, Pravin must go! Make your voice heard. Sign the petition”. You may access the petition to sign via the link, http://chng.it/bGWxxCxN: No related posts.
