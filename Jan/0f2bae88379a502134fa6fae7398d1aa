Pravin Gordhan. Image credit: Netwerk24 By BO Staff writer Black First Land First (BLF) President, Andile Mngxitama, has just announced that his organization will launch an online petition today to give South Africans a voice to tell President Cyril Ramaphosa to end loadsheding by firing Pravin Gordhan as Minister of Public Enterprises and hiring proven sector leaders to end loadsheding again, namely Dr Ben Ngubane; Brain Molefe; and Matshela Koko. As many as 10 thousand people are expected to sign this petition. “Loadsheding is part of the standard procedure of privatization. To this end it is employed as a tactic to terrorize the people into consenting to privatization of Eskom so as to ensure that the SOE goes under the hammer for next to nothing“, Mngxitama told Black Opinion last week. Moreover, “the energy crisis brought about through Eskom entails Gordhan misleading the State President”, he pointed out. To mobilize the people, amongst other things, Mngxitama said that tables will be organised in public places across the country to gather and process names for the petition, which will ultimately be sent to President Ramaphosa.
