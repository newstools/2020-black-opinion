GMO maize farming in South Africa. Image credit: GLP Black First Land First (BLF) is duty bound to raise its voice against the conspiracy to poison black people for profits. White farmers in South Africa (SA) have turned agriculture into an industry of possible genocide and disease. Over 90% of our maize is genetically modified organism (GMO). . Our government allows it. SA is the only country on earth that allows its staple food to be genetically modified. While other nations feed animals GMO maize, SA gives it to blacks. We are a country be-felled and ravaged by chronic illnesses and diseases that we have never experienced before. Many people suffer and die for instance from cancer, diabetes and related diseases. We eat what we donâ€™t know. Maize is a staple diet for blacks. The fact that white farmers have turned maize into a GMO crop is another indication of how racist the agricultural sector is. The destruction of the soil and poisoning of people, through GMO foods, for profits must end. Land must he given to black people so that indigenous organic farming can be given a chance and our people can heal. We say no to Frankenstein maize.
