By Andile Mngxitama How is this possible? What muti do the relatives of politicians drink to make them overnight handlers of businesses of millions of rand. Think about Floyd Shivambu and his brother Brian Shivambu; as well as Julius Malema and his cousin Matsobane Phaleng, regarding VBS looting of millions. Effectively Sgameka, a company owned by Brian Shivambu, made dubious payments to Mahuna, a company owned by Matsobane Phaleng. These companies conducted business like slush funds moving funds to wherever it was needed. Now we have the case of Jabu Mabuza and his relative Nomvula Mabuza who owns IDS Industry Service and Plant Construction Africa. Moreover Nomvula established this company soon after Jabu was appointed chair of Eskom and shortly thereafter she scores a R100 million contract with Eskom. Floyd, Julius, Jabu â€“ these are celebrated corruption busters of South Africa! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
