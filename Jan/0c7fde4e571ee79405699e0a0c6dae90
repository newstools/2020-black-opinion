The official U.S position for sanctioning the Guptas is because of their close links to President Zuma which they had used to benefit financially and to influence appointments to key posts. Zuma was seen as being too close to BRICS and the Guptas, and problematic to white capital which had decided that he must go for those reasons. So the global anti BRICS process collaborated with the local anti Gupta white capital campaign to get rid of Zuma (as they did) via a Brazilian like coup of Dilma Rousseff. Donald Trump had decided to join London and Stellenbosch (settler white monopoly capital) against the Guptas. The question is, does this act not “objectively” put the Guptas in the anti imperialist ranks? Mao Zedong teaches us that, “the enemy of my enemy is my friend”. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
