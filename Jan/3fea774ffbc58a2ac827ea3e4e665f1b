By Andile Mngxitama Did you know that formal apartheid was launched in South Africa (SA) in 1948 and ended in 1994. That’s a life span of 46 years. In that period the Afrikaners completely set themselves up – from agriculture, to banking to, insurance. Do you know that the African National Congress (ANC) has been in power now for the 25 years! That’s more than half the period of formal Afrikaner power. And what did blacks get so far in this period of ANC power? Let’s take a look: 1. 80% of the land in white hands
2. 97% of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) in white hands
3. 90% of infrastructure expenditure goes to white monopoly capital (WMC).
4. No state bank
5. No anything… 46 years of formal apartheid rule did wonders for whites. In 25 years of ANC rule, blacks got nothing. We just exist as people nje… fok man! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
