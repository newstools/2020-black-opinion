Image credit: Kopano Tlape/GCIS By Andile Mngxitama Cyril Ramaphosa said that Eskom won’t be privatized. If you believe him and don’t know that privatization is on the way, then consider yourself too ignorant. I’m sure that you also wouldn’t know anything about the R1 billion given by white monopoly capital (WMC) to Ramaphosa to buy the African National Congress (ANC) conference in Nasrec in December 2017. Moreover the name Stephen Koseff is not likely to register with you. I guess some of us are here to tell you the truth. Ramaphosa is lying to you. Koseff told him to never use the word privatization. So you have been had! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
