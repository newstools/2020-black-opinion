By Andile Mngxitama The story of Steve Biko’s assassination is similar to that of Martin Luther King, Jr (MLK). The apartheid police did the initial attack on Biko; the doctors concealed it; and the judges and prosecutors made sure that the killers were never made to account. So the whole white establishment assassinated him. The white system is decisive in its defence of white interests. It’s black people who are easily bought with trinkets like Louis Vuitton. Until we blacks learn to act in our own self interests, until we learn self sacrifice for the black race – we won’t make progress. We are fighting an evil system controlled by evil people. Dr. William Pepper clarifies the circumstances of the killing of MLK in the YouTube videos “Who Really Killed Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.?“ Part 1 and Part 2 which may be viewed via the links, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHjb3CjHNoE; and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx9djjPVqQg respectively. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
