These kids know instinctively that for the next 12 years they will be tortured into being docile stupid people who live for jobs and are always terrified of the boss. I get the kids who refuse to go into an assembly line like battery chickens for 12 years! It’s torture. No human being should endure so much hell. When I was in grade 2, I figured that school was for demented fools. I just couldn’t believe that anyone could dream up such a system. So since school was far and I mostly walked to it alone, I just absconded for a whole term. Every morning I woke up and when I was half way to school I would turn to my non school going friend and we hanged. My mother still laughs at me about it. My dad beat me up into going back to school. Thanks to him I’m able to put together broken English sentences on Facebook. But my freedom time was experienced outside the classroom with my cattle herding chomie. I’m with the rebels, fuck school!
