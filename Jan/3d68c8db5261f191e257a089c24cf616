Image credit: BizNews Black First Land First (BLF) is pleased to announce that the target for Day 1 of the “Stop Loadshedding, Pravin Gordhan Must Go” petition has been met. BLF launched the online petition an hour before midday today. The target for the first day, which was set at 1000 signatures, was achieved way in advance of the end of the day. The campaign aims to achieve the grand total of 10 000 (ten thousands) signatures for submission to the president of the country, Cyril Ramaphosa. The petition serves to put pressure on Ramaphosa to recall Gordhan from his position as Minister. The positive response from South Africans shows that there is a national consensus that Pravin Must Go! BLF will keep the public informed with daily updates on progress towards obtaining the 10 000 signatures.
