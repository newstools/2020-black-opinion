Johann Rupert. Photo credit: Gallo Images: By BO Staff Writer Bloomberg has confirmed that Johann Rupert has overtaken the secretive Nicky Oppenheimer as the wealthiest person in South Africa (SA). Rupert achieved this from the gift of profits amassed since Cyril Ramaphosa took over as President of the country. It must be remembered that Rupert was in the forefront of the “Zuma Must Go” campaign because he stood to lose the most from Jacob Zuma’s Radical Economic Transformation (RET) program. Julius Malema had openly asked Rupert to fund him so that he can fight Zuma. According to Rupert, he subsequently had dinner with Malema’s deputy, Floyd Shivambu, in Stellenbosch where money and donations were discussed. Furthermore, Shivambu acted as political advisor to Rupert. It now appears that Rupert got great returns from all his investments in both Malema and Ramaphosa. Rupert practically controls the South African political scene through his money. Those that he can’t buy, he crushes just like he has done with Black First Land First (BLF). Rupert has over 30 High Court interdicts against BLF which is aimed at arresting land redress led by the organisation in Franschoek and other areas. The real beneficiaries of the “new dawn” are now emerging for all to see. Next is the selling of Eskom to the same Stellenbosch Mafia under the wing of Rupert. Even the former Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela, was given a golden handshake for protecting Rupert. She has been given professorship and a cushy job at the University of Stellenbosch where Rupert is a chancellor and a very powerful figure. Johann Rupert is a happy man, making a whopping R11 billion in one year. No related posts.
