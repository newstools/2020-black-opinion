By Andile Mngxitama Did you know that there are two land expropriation bills before parliament? Do you know the relationship between these two? Why are the political parties in parliament not making noise about this? In the first episode of “The Black Perspective” I will deal with one of the biggest hoaxes of our time: Land Expropriation Without Compensation.
