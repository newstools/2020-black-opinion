By Andile Mngxitama This US strike on the Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani, feels like the assassination of Chris Hani. The uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) units had apparently been prepared to hit back should there be an assassination of any of the big shots. Hani himself had been responsible for these units. It was clear that in the event of an assassination, pre selected targets were to be hit. All we know from Frank B. Wilderson III is that a bunch of academics and members of the South African Students Congress (SASCO) from Wits University, clumsily lobbed some grenades at some building – and that’s how actual resistance ended and Madiba got a date for the elections. This whole thing with Soleimani feels like that… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
