Photo credit: News24 By BO Staff Writer We remember Wednesday April 12, 2017, the day of national disgrace. It was the day when the instructions from Lord Robin Renwick and Johann Rupert (London and Stellenbosch) to their agents (mainly the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) President, Julius Malema, and his Deputy, Floyd Shivambu), to lead their parties in a march to the Union Buildings in furtherance of the “Zuma Must Go” campaign, were duly executed. The Save SA march on April 7, 2017, served a similar agenda. Julius and Floyd conceded because of their love of the Louis Vuitton and Range Rover lifestyle of over consumption. We shall never forget! We can’t forget how the EFF (led by Malema) marched hand in hand with other pro imperialist and white monopoly capital (WMC) political parties and organizations. We also remember how the streets of Pretoria were filled with red and blue showing the strong alliance between the EFF and the party of WMC , the Democratic Alliance (DA). History shall judge the sellouts! No related posts.
