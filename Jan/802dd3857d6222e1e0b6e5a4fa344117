Image: via IOL By BO Staff Writer The State-capture commission will today hear an application by its legal team for Jacob Zuma to be summoned to appear before it over the period 27 to 31 January. The Commission wants Zuma to tell it, at the instance of white monopoly capital (WMC) stooges, about his links with the Guptas, who it accuses of state-capture. Zuma, who denies any wrongdoing, says that the commission is impartial and biased. Zuma last appeared before the commission on 15 July 2019 and was unable to appear from November 11 to 15 due to ill health. During his tenure as State President of South Africa (SA), Zuma had defended the national sovereignty of the country via his radical economic transformation (RET) agenda. He was problematic to white capital and was seen as being too close to BRICS and the Guptas. So through a collaboration of the anti BRICS process globally with the anti Gupta WMC campaign locally, Zuma was removed from power via a Dilma Rousseff Brazilian like coup. Both Zuma and the Guptas were labelled by WMC as the most corrupt people responsible for state capture. In the meantime the black consciousness organization, Black First Land First (BLF), who have historically defended Zuma and the Guptas for their anti WMC and pro RET stance, has said via its president Andile Mngxitama that, “making these two the enemy is a strategy that distracts us with side issues to protect white capital”. Moverever, “economic terrorism has been conducted on the Guptas (who only supplied 5% of ESKOM’s coal needs at that time) by WMC which wanted them out of the mining so that white dominance (which supplied 95% of ESKOM’s coal needs) over the sector is protected”, Mngxitama pointed out.
