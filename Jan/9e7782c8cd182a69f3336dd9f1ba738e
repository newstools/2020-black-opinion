Image credit: The Citizen By BO Staff Writer Once again another employee of the so called Marxist-Leninist party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), has revealed that his worker’s rights have been abused. Frans James, the former Free State Administrator of the EFF, has revealed the horror of being employed by the party of Julius Malema which claims to fight for workers’ rights. James was dismissed like a dog for merely demanding that his rights as a worker be respected. James says that he questioned Malema’s instruction to dock his salary – an order which is in line with the EFF’s practice of illegally reducing the salary due to a worker as a punishment. The practice is further characterized by favoritism. To this end James revealed that Malema’s party unlawfully reduced his salary from R34 000 to R20 000 and consequently owes him half a million rand. James says that the EFF fired him without notice on a back dated dismissal letter. He has now put his hope for justice on the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), after the party that puts on workers clothes proved to be capitalist monsters in workers attire. Many on social media have suggested that Julius Malema and Floyd Shivambu rob the EFF’s staff of their salaries to sponsor their addiction to the Louis Vuitton and Range Rover lifestyle.
