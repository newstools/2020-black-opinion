Image credit: Gallo Images By Andile Mngxitama Some amongst us are correctly still angry that the Guptas landing at the Waterkloof Airport (WKF). Note the WKF is not a National Key Point (NKP). On the other hand, some amongst us are not angry at all about the fact that the Oppenheimer family had bribed the African National Congress (ANC) to give them a private international airport inside the OR Tambo International Airport, which is in fact a NKP. And the Oppenheimers didn’t go to government, they went to Luthuli House where Gwede Mantashe, the “new dawn“ Don, granted them permission. Is that not ironic? Why is your anger selective? Why is white corruption acceptable to you? Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
