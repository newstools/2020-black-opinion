Jonathan and Nicky Oppenheimer in Parliament. Photo credit:: ANA By Andile Mngxitama Good morning fam. Do you know that the only organization that has ever taken the Oppenheimers on directly is Black First Land First (BLF)? The Oppenheimers were forced to go to parliament to explain their criminal activities around acquiring a private international airport inside the O.R Tambo International Airport. The father and son (Nicky and Jonathan) of the secret Oppenheimer dynasty attended the parliamentary committee hearing. Can you believe it? The Louis Vuitton brigade’s leadership ran away from parliament that day. There was no “pay back the money” type of chants against the dynasty. The red overalls went under the bed. The African National Congress (ANC), that constituted the committee, were reduced to bodyguards of the Oppenheimers. It was left to BLF to confront the Oppenheimers, the real enemies of economic freedom. I remain very proud of this moment in our movement’s history. Your leaders are in the pockets of the enemy, my people. Good morning in this year of Awakening & Organizing! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
