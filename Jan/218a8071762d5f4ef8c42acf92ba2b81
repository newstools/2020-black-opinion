Image credit: BizNews Black First Land First (BLF)has today launched an online petition which says, “Stop Loadshedding! Pravin Gordhan Must Go!”You may sign the petition via the following link, http://chng.it/bGWxxCxN: Following the deepening crisis around energy supply in South Africa (SA), BLF believes that as long as Pravin Gordhan is a Minister, there shall be no solution to this situation. Gordhan is a conflicted Minister whose business partners stand to benefit from the privatization of Eskom. The loadsheding currently experienced in SA is functional to the agenda of privatization. Loadsheding had previously been brought to an end through the joint leadership of Dr Ngubane, Brian Molefe and Matshela Koko. These compatriots wouldn’t say no to serving the nation again but Gordhan doesn’t want a resolution of the crisis for Eskom. The employment of the incompetent Andre de Ruyter as the new chief executive officer (CEO) of Eskom, is yet another good reason to recall Gordhan pronto. Enough is enough! Ramaphosa must end loadshedding by firing Pravin. Make your voice heard. Do sign the petition.
