What utter nonsense! Ja, did you hear that? The ANC of Ramaphosa believes that land thieves can’t wait to give us back our land for free! Government, to this end, is making it easy for them to do so. It is launching an “online system” where land thieves can log in and “donate” back the stolen land. To this end the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform published a draft national policy for land allocation last week. This suggests that the 350 years of mass murder and plunder by whites to keep the land has not happened. Someone tell the ANC of Ramaphosa that thieves are not in the habit of giving back stuff they have stolen. That’s why thieving is a criminal offence. Cowardice and love for money explains this childlike embarrassing act by the ANC of Ramaphosa. Jacob Zuma said that black political parties must unite and amend the constitution to take back the land. To avoid proper land expropriation, Ramaphosa is begging land thieves to “donate” some of the land they have stolen. This is madness and an insult to black people. There shall be no land expropriation without compensation driven by Ramaphosa and the Louis Vuitton addicts.
