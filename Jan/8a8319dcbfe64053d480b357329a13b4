By Andile Mngxitama I’m an entry level Black Consciousness (BC) educator. I only improve techniques with time but my message for the last 20 years has been the same. I repeat myself all the time because I’m always engaging entry level participants. That’s what good teachers do, more so BC teachers. They repeat themselves until the message is grasped. The black condition remains as it was for the last 500 years or so. Often some of my former students think they know more than me. Most don’t. A good few have however gone on to cultivate themselves and become masters in the area of black radical thought. A good teacher is a permanent student. I learn every day. Mao Zedong correctly puts it like this: “Naturally, we have to learn while teaching and be pupils while serving as teachers. To be a good teacher, one must first be a good pupil. “ What I’m saying is this: perception changing is long hard labor; there are no easy victories; it is painful, like dequiling a porcupine. Today more people understand what we are saying as compared to 10 years ago. There are no short cuts. Yes you do despair at times doing this kind of labor. It can get so frustrating that you ask yourself, “why do I care“. Then you remember – there is no other alternative to black liberation… Good morning black people and I love you all!
