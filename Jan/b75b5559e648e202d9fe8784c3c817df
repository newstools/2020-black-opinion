By Andile Mngxitama This is the Deputy President (DP) of Black First Land First (BLF) with the father of radical economic transformation (RET), Jacob Zuma. Great revolutionary people in our time. But I was just complaining to the DP this morning that I’m sick and tired of strangers whose first few lines are, “yhuuu the DP of BLF is beautiful. Is she married?” I used to get pissed off because the DP is a leader first and foremost. Now, I just let these people be. One asked me what can happen if the leader is also pretty? It’s not easy in the revolution. Have a pleasant Friday… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization. No related posts.
