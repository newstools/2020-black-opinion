There is no shadow of doubt that Gordhan is incompetent to sort out the energy crisis. Furthermore, the fact that he is conflicted means that he has no interest in ending loadsheding. The board and DD Mabuza must not be made the scapegoat to allow Gordhan to continue with his sabotage of national interests. There is national consensus that Gordhan must go. Cyril Ramaphosa must not be stubborn like the evil Pharaoh. Too many plagues have already afflicted South Africa. Black First Land First (BLF) calls on Ramaphosa to do the right thing. We say, fire Gordhan now!
