The government of South Africa (SA) is scared of white hooligans who break the law at will. These land thieves murder and evict blacks on farms everyday without any consequences. Today we saw them attack the court buildings and even burn a police vehicle in broad day light in Senekal, Free State. They further endangered the lives of the suspects. Black First Land First (BLF) calls on the government of Cyril Ramaphosa to guarantee the safety and rights of the suspects. When whites murder blacks they are assumed to be innocent until proven otherwise. Generally we know the courts are lenient on whites who murder blacks. Why did the police allow the Boere hordes to get close to the police Casspir which was ferrying the accused? It is clear to BLF that the court has already been intimidated and therefore the accused will not get a fair trial. BLF calls for the arrest of the hooligans without a further waste of time. If the government doesn’t want to protect black people, then we shall have no option but to arm and protect ourselves. To end the violence against farm workers, it’s important that land is expropriated without compensation. The power of the white farmer to be racist comes from land ownership.
