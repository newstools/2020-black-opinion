The Nigerian youth stood up and said enough is enough against the Nigerian police’s Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). Their actions bore immediate results when the Nigerian neocolonial violent government acceded to the demands of the protestors to disband SARS. Black First Land First (BLF) agrees with the Nigerian revolutionary youth who said that the disbandment of the SARS is not enough. The protest must reclaim the great nation of Nigeria from the corrupt politicians who sold the national wealth to imperialism. The question must be asked, if Nigeria is so wealthy why are its people so poor? Who eats the oil money? The police are brutal because they are the militias of the looters of Nigeria. We say to the brave young people of Nigeria, “you are on a momentum towards changing the bitter history of Nigeria. Go all the way. Make a revolution. Give your nation a new day.“ BLF supports and salutes the End SARS movement. Your courage gives us hope in South Africa. Amandla!
