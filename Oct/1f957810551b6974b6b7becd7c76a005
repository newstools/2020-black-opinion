By BO Staff Writer Gayton McKenzie and his Patriotic Alliance appear to have become enemy number one for white monopoly capital and its stooges. McKenzie became a major subject in white monopoly capital-owned newspapers over the weekend. The plan is to tarnish his name with the hope of stopping the massive anti-corruption clean-up currently under way in the Department of Economic Development (DED) in the City of Joburg. The Patriotic Alliance through a power sharing arrangement with the ANC is responsible for the DED. Several investigations have revealed massive corruption that was taking place under the Mashaba administration of the DA. The DED didn’t waste time to take action. Furthermore, Mashaba and Julius Malema-appointed officials continued with the looting of Covid-19 funds. Here again PA put its foot down and demanded action. These executives who are implicated in corruption are DA linked. The media is being used to unleash a dirty war against Gayton McKenzie in a desperate attempt to stop the multiple investigations that involve millions of rands. Since the arrival of the PA in the DED the corrupt officials have nowhere to hide. They first tried to use the trade unions to block investigations. Now they have turned to the media to try to tarnish the name of Gayton McKenzie. So desperate is white monopoly capital to silence McKenzie that it has enlisted the services of a racist Afrikaner called David van Wyk to spread lies and slander against Gayton McKenzie. A related fear that fuels the dirty campaign against McKenzie is the fact that the PA has grown very popular in Ward 68, which is being highly contested in the upcoming by-elections. The DA is scared it will lose the ward to the PA. That’s why there is this massive pushback through media propaganda. It’s going to get even more dirty towards 11 November when the by-election is held.
