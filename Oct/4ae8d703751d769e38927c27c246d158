Black lawyers have often represented our movement without asking for fees. The late Advocate Valentine Simelane represented the BLF 26 for over two years without any fees. He was there at every hearing and made sure that the matter was withdrawn. Many other black lawyers have represented us for free. Black First Land First (BLF) is grateful for all the sacrifices black lawyers have made in defending our rights in the court system. We reject with contempt the notion that black lawyers are incompetent. We believe such notions reflect an anti black attitude. BLF has since its inception taken the position that it shall not use white lawyers. We have stuck by that position and where black lawyers werenâ€™t available, our movement represented itself. BLF hereby once more expresses its vote of confidence in black lawyers and black professionals in general.
