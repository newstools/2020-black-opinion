BLF has opened a criminal case against President Ramaphosa related to the CR17 campaign donations. President Ramaphosa has concealed his donors to ostensibly conceal the ongoing conflict of interests emanating from those who gave him R1 billion to win the ANC presidency. BLF believes the Mooikloof Mega City main beneficiary, the Balwin Properties, may be the donor Tony Leon has alleged had given President Ramaphosa a R30 million donation towards the CR17 campaign. BLF shall alert the investigating Officer from the Hawks to investigate if indeed Balwin Properties is the R30 million donor to CR17. BLF also notes that Balwin Properties is not a BBBEE compliant company. Furthermore; it seems that itâ€™s own BBBEE certificate has expired. These issues will be investigated and further appropriate action taken. What is clear to BLF is that all CR17 donors are allowed to break the law with impunity whilst their identities remain concealed.
