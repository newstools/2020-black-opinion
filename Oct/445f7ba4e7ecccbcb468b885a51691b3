The accused persons in the alleged farm murder case in Senekal have already been found guilty without a trial. Julius Malema called them murderers who must rot in jail. The court has decided to hold the proceedings in secret to protect what we believe to be a white farmer who is conducting the whole kangaroo court. In a democracy, the court process needs to be open to meet the public expectations of being unbiased. BLF believes the court and politicians are involved in a conspiracy to deny the accused persons the right to a fair trial. The accused are already prejudiced in a secret apartheid like court. Black First Land First (BLF) demands an open trial so that the nation can see for itself how biased the courts are against farm workers.
