By Andile Mngxitama If you think Ace Magashule is in the dock because Cyril Ramaphosa’s administration is fighting corruption, you are a hopeless moron. This is about Stellenbosch consolidating its hold on the ANC and making sure no one challenges it. Stellenbosch has the state (the NPA and judiciary) to fight its battles plus money to buy ANC delegates and leaders. Right now Stellenbosch doesn’t need the DA and the Mazzotti boys. It has the ANC and is using the state to make sure its hold on the ANC is tight. Ace is not in court because of corruption. He is in court because he is seen as a threat to the the Stellenbosch agenda. Don’t be a moron! Open your eyes….
