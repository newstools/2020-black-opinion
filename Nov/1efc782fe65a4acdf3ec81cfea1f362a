Africa’s largest stadium, FNB stadium, packed to capacity during Prophet Bushiri’s New Year’s cross over service By Andile Mngxitama That’s ECG filling up the FNB. This over 100 000 people. This is a massive economic loss for the City of Joburg if this event stops. This loss is likely to be the gain of Lilongwe, Malawi‘s capital. The population size of Lilongwe is about 1.2 million. The average of 100 000 people per day over 5 days is equivalent to 50% of the City’s population. You can imagine the massive economic spin-offs (accommodation, food, travel, mementoes, etc). It’s a massive tourism boost. Just thinking purely economics now. Only a foolish government can let go of such massive economic benefits. If I were the Mayor of Joburg, I will be making a serious call for the persecution of Major1 to stop for the sake of our economy.
