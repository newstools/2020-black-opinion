It is clear to all fair minded people that the South African government has waged a vendetta against Prophet Bushiri. The government of South Africa is not interested in the Rule of Law. It’s interested in tarnishing the name of the Prophet. The latest media driven negative propaganda against Major 1 is a desperate attempt to remove focus from the clear and legal demands made by Prophet Bushiri to come and answer the charges against him. It’s clear that the South African government has no case against the Prophet, hence the manufacturing of charges and feeding the media frenzy in an attempt to conduct a trial by media. It’s clear that Prophet Bushiri shall never receive a fair trial in South Africa under the Ramaphosa administration. Stellenbosch is threatened by the Prophet hence the persecution we see. Black First Land First (BLF) calls on the South African government to stop the persecution of Prophet Bushiri and meet his demands to ensure his right to a fair trial and to safety. It is clear that South Africa is under white control and black people who are not controlled by white power and are able to stand on their own are destroyed.
