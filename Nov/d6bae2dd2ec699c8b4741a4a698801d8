By Andile Mngxitama The black church is under attack and no political party is defending it. Ray McCauley has been scamming blacks for years. A racist, violent man but because he is white, he is still operating his church. We know he wants to own the Pentecostal churches and is using that evil Commission on Religious Affairs for this capture of the black church. In 2017 I met with about 20 Bishops of the independent black churches. They explained how Ray Mcauley is using the Commission to capture the black independent churches. The attack on Major 1 is not a mistake. It’s part of the move to control every aspect of black life. They took the land, now they want to take even the church which emerged independent of the white church! The sin of Major 1 was to build a church much much bigger than the one built by the white man. Many young professionals are leaving their churches for the ECG. We can see what’s going on here…. Wake up darkie!!! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
