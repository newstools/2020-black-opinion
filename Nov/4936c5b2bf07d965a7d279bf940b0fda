Black First Land First (BLF) condemns the racist administration of the Democratic Alliance (DA) in Cape Town for using its police to attack the vulnerable. The video material that has gone viral shows police brutality against Comrade Zwelenkosi Ngidi, the Provincial Chairperson of BLF in the Eastern Cape. Comrade Ngidi was part of a peaceful protest that seeks service delivery for abandoned people of Cape Town when the DA government there typically responded with violence. We call upon the City of Cape Town to compensate Comrade Ngidi for the pain and suffering inflicted upon him. We also demand a public apology from both the City and the perpetrators. But more importantly, the police who carried out the attack and the entire police department must undergo education in Black Consciousness so as to understand the value of black lives and how to treat black people with dignity.
