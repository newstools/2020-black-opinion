By Andile Mngxitama Things are happening. Just met a brother who does his own bakkie transportation business. He asked for a selfie. He was happy to see me. Then he asked to buy me cold drink. He donated R200.00 of his hard earned cash. Iâ€™m humbled. God is showing signs. We must remain resolute and focused. We must be united. We are going to defeat this evil government, return the stolen land and protect the rights of all. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
