By Andile Mngxitama In 1998 John Pilger produced a documentary film entitled Apartheid Did Not Die. It was a scathing attack on Mandela and Thabo Mbeki. It repeated every criticism that the PAC and AZAPO made about the negotiations. It repeated the criticism we made of GEAR and neoliberalism. John Pilger has stolen from us without knowing or meaning to. He thought he was helping when in fact he was dispossessing us of the right of our voices to be heard. He was a thief just like the whites that he was criticizing who stole our land. I was disgusted by this British man who arrogated unto himself the right to insult Mandela and Mbeki. Whiteness denies us even the right to insult our own. I remain disgusted by whites who speak on our behalf today, just like I was disgusted by those TAC racists white boys who were insulting Dr Manto Tshabalala-Msimang around the time of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. No white has any moral standing to speak on behalf of blacks. Until we get this, we still donâ€™t understand the totality of white power. Whiteness exists on the basis of taking from blacks.
