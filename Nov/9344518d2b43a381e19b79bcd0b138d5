By Andile Mngxitama I donâ€™t defend you because you are a saint. I defend you because you are under attack from an enemy that has been attacking us for the last 500 years. Whether we are guilty or innocent has never saved us from the enemy attack. They have murdered our prophets and leaders over the the centuries. What make us now believe their claims against our own? And oh yes, they have used some of us to validate the persecution of our prophets and leaders. Who gave evidence and testified against Marcus Garvey? Who pulled the trigger on Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Assassinations? Not a black hand? I stand with the accused because of the weight of evidence of 500 years! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
