By Andile Mngxitama Good morning dear all Let’s stop complaining. Let’s get rid of this evil system so that we may enjoy the wealth God gave this country and be protected against bullies who run this government. Why are we poor in a country with so much wealth? Its evil! Victory is ours! We do not have any doubts for we have chosen to walk with the children of God. The devil is a liar! Don’t forget to join BLF. Big announcement coming soon. We are ona move! Walala wa sala! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
