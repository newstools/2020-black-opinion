By Andile Mngxitama The black boy raises his machete and chops the head of a snake. Enablers jump with indignation and declares him a criminal that must rot in jail. The heroic acts of the black boy are imagined but his condemnation is real. Those who make common cause with the snake against the black boy are enablers of racism. The only known remedy for individual acts of racism is not posturing but the soft lending of the machete at dawn. The enablers of racism choose to fight the holder of the machete and when the snake bites all including the enabler, there is feigned mass suprise. Beware of enablers of racism amongst us. They enact empty spectacles whilst enabling the snake to breath and thrive as the better devil. The only force fighting individual acts of racism here is the black boy in Senekal whom the enablers want buried deep under the cold weight of jail. Everything else is a spectacle for votes. Know who the enablers of racism amongst us are. Fighting time is thinking time or we will repeat the cycle of defeat… I long for a thousand black boys on chariots wielding machetes at the dead of night…. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
