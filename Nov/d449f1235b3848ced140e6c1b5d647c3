By Andile Mngxitama We aren’t afraid to stand alone on the side of the truth. We aren’t afraid to be ridiculed for taking such a stand. We aren’t afraid to lose friends and comrades for the truth. In 2016, when it was not fashionable, we alone said “Hands Off Zuma”. We were called names. Today, almost everyone can see the truth. We are today standing with Major 1. We face the same insults and ridicule. Our conscience is clear. Major 1 is a victim of the same forces that are fighting Zuma. We can’t be selective about the truth. We stand with the man of God 100% and if you don’t like that, go jump off a cliff! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
