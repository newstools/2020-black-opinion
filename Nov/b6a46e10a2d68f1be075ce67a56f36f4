By Andile Mngxitama There is a time when an excited new woke writes a long comment with half-baked facts and lots of blaster. You then think, “let me educate this one” but then think, “no man, block and delete, this is a manifestation of demonic forces”. Lol… How do you even debate with someone who is denouncing Christianity and claims to follow Marcus Garvey but doesn’t know that Garvey was a deep Christian? Demons all over… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
