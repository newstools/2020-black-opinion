Before you argue with me go and read up on NAT TURNER. It’s a sin to be oppressed and allow evil to reign supreme in our midst. God gave us brains and God gave us wisdom – Hokma! Cowards blame Christianity for not fighting for their liberation. Sobukwe was a Christian.
Biko was a Christian.
Garvey was a Christian. Time to defeat evil… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
