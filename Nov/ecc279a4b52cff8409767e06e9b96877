By Andile Mngxitama Why are people getting heart attacks when BLF and ECG members show appreciation for the truth? Wait until I jump in an aeroplane or bus to Lilongwe to see the Prophet. The evil will burn in their own bile of hate. As the song says, they donâ€™t wanna see us together!!! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
