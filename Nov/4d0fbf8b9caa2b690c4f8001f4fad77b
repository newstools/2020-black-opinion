Black First Land First (BLF) is appalled by the sentence given to the Cape Town white woman of a 10-year suspended sentence for human trafficking, amongst other serious crimes. Camilla de Waal Rossouw who is 32 years old, was sentenced last Friday by the High Court in Cape Town. The court has shown that if you are white you can commit heinous crimes and you will be let off the hook. Human trafficking is serious in South Africa. Children and women are the most affected. This sentence encourages whites to carry out these sorts of crimes. If the perpetrator were black, the court would have correctly sentenced them to life but because itâ€™s a white woman the court is prepared to look the other way. This woman is dangerous; she pleaded guilty to over 11 charges which included kidnapping a child, human trafficking, trafficking for sexual slavery, assault, keeping of a brothel, living on the proceeds of prostitution and extortion involving more than R3 million. This woman belongs in jail. BLF shall immediately write to the NPA to appeal the sentence. Next month South Africa observes the month of no abuse against women and children. However, sentences like this makes a mockery of efforts to end gender based violence. Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC)
