By Andile Mngxitama I can’t believe I went live by complete mistake earlier. I had the phone in hand. Anyway it went live as I was finishing my conversation with the Principal of the creche and her Deputy in Pennyville. We were at a closing rally for the by-election in Ward 68. From there I went to check on the food. The creche permitted us to prepare the food. So when I walked in I met the creche leadership. They know me. We have been helping where we can. Before the Covid-19 shutdown, we helped fix the electricity problem after the whole wiring was stolen. Together with Sister Ntsiki we raised some funds to feed the kids. We also asked, “let’s coin for support“. So we have a relationship. PA has just bought a jumping castle for the creche. Those who saw the video should have heard the challenges of the creche. They have a graduation in the beginning of December and have 7 teachers who haven’t been paid since March. We are going to try and help where we can. Anyway, viewing the accidental video makes me happy because with all the people we have free flowing natural relationships. There is no leadership celebrity bullshit. We love the people and the people love us back and that’s it. If you are in Ward 68 in the Cty of Joburg on Wednesday, vote PA.
