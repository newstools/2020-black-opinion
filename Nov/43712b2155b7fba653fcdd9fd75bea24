Patrotic Alliance President, Gayton McKenzie History was made last night when the Patrotic Alliance (PA), which is led by Gayton McKenzie, had a decisive victory in Ward 68 in the City of Johannesburg Municipal By-Elections. The PA took the ward from the racist Democratic Alliance (DA) which had taken it from the inept ANC in 2016. This victory shows that people UNITED can never be defeated. Black First Land First (BLF) and Sakhisizwe Convention (SA) joined forces with the PA and defeated the ANC, DA, EFF, ACDP. Ward 68 straddles Pennyville in Soweto, and Riverlea which is a so-called Colored area. The three parties set aside their different self interests and put the people first. The people responded with a decisive mandate because the tripartite arrangement gave them hope. BLF used the campaigning in Ward 68 to prepare for the 2021 Local Government Elections. BLF will be on the ballot in 2021. This moment belongs to the courageous people of Ward 68. We vow to be your eyes and ears. We shall not fail.
