By Andile Mngxitama The government of Ramaphosa is encouraging war between blacks. The Truck Drivers issue has been left unattended, so now people are acting out their frustrations. This is not an impossible situation to solve. The SA white people who own trucks are the ones who make our people fight each other. All the white employers in SA are breaking the law for profits and make poor people fight amongst themselves – and the government and parliament are folding their arms. We have no goverment that puts black people First! We have no black representation in parliament. We must fix this… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
