By Andile Mngxitama Please man, if you have no ideology you are going to chase events emanating from the central antagonism. And since you don’t know what the main contradiction is you will be forming a political party for each of the secondary contradictions created by the main contradiction. You will form a party to fight immigrants because they “take our jobs”. You will form another party to fight Indians because they own the vegetable stalls in Durban. You will form a party to fight Coloreds in the Western Cape because they undermine us. Without ideology you wouldn’t know that all these are secondary contradictions created by the main contradiction which is white monopoly capital (WMC) in the economic sphere. In fact such parties are agents of WMC, that’s why Mashaba is so heavily funded by it. WMC would be happy to see Indians and Africans fight. It’s a battle that takes us away from the main battle. These parties fighting secondary battles take our gaze from the real enemy, the land thieves. Keep your eyes on the prize. Never go back to pre Steve Biko in understanding the South African reality. Without ideology you will keep us busy with nonsense. Once we defeat the real enemy, all shall give us the respect we deserve. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
