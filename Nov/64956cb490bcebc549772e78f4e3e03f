By Andile Mngxitama Stellenbosch is not involved in silly games. It bought a President for R1 billion. Now it’s making sure its power is not challenged. It owns the ANC and therefore the state. Stellenbosch doesn’t want to kill the ANC. It just needs to make sure that the ANC is under its control completely. Right now it’s clear that this objective will be achieved and blacks will be voting for Stellenbosch via the ANC. It’s a great heist! Under these conditions the best form of defence is attack! But the RET forces inside the ANC are too disciplined so they will be purged and locked up at will. Stellenbosch is at war! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
