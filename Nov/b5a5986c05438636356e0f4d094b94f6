By Andile Mngxitama I had an interview on Wednesday with eNCA on a number of issues. They also asked me, “do you support Bushiri?” They gave the background of the so-called “fugitive”. I laughed and told them that I derive internal pleasure when a black person beats an evil system. I told them the SA goverment is evil and subverting the rule of law; that as a revolutionary I can’t but celebrate when a black person is able to pull one back for us. Lol, the interviewer’s face suggested confusion in his head. In my heart I said, “Hokma Wisdom!” They said they will flight it in the news this afternoon. Will share the link once I get it.
You know eNCA also mos… lol… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
