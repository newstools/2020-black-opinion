Black First Land First (BLF) is aware that Julius Malema is on the verge of pick pocketing Clicks. A meeting like that of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) will be held today with Clicks. This tea and biscuits meeting follows the same pattern of meetings like those held with the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) executives after the 50,000 people march in October 2015. After the meeting with the JSE, the demands of the march were forgotten. The same happened after Malema’s meeting with Patrice Motsepe who was threatened with exposing his role in the Independent Power Producers (PPIs) situation. BLF supports all genuine struggles against any acts of racism. However, we are critical of the opportunistic use of struggles against racism for self-aggrandizement by corrupt politicians. Clicks is bullied into meetings to cut deals but not to end racism. The only way to end the racism of Clicks is to demand 51% black ownership of the business – with workers and the unemployed youth being beneficiaries, not any politician. BLF therefore calls on Clicks to show authentic remorse by giving real black ownership of 51% to its black workers and the unemployed youth. Racism will not be brought to an end by platitudes and meetings. No more CODESA-like sellout solutions. Only real black empowerment will end racism.
