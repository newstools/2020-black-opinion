Black First Land First (BLF) rejects the sell-out agreement between the EFF and Unilever. BLF had cautioned that the EFF was entering into a CODESA like sell-out deal. We were right. The whole negotiations served  to protect the executive who was responsible for the racist advertisement. We now believe that the executive is a white man. Both the EFF and Unilever agreed to lie to the nation and say that the responsible executive has left the country. South Africa (SA) is under Covid-19 lockdown and international travel is banned. How could the executive have left the country? It’s a pure lie to protect the racist. BLF will write a letter to Unilever and demand that it reveals the name of the executive, and gives 51% ownership to blacks without further delay. We will not allow the EFF to protect the racist executive and racism in exchange for 10 000 sanitary pads and 5 black students getting bursaries.
