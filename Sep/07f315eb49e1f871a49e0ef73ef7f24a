Cyril Ramaphosa has now allowed Eskom to annex 139 farms of the Matjhabeng Municipality. This is expropriation without compensation of land that must be given to the landless majority. Eskom is being prepared for privatization and handing over to creditors and friends. This means that the 139 farms would soon be taken by Cyril Ramaphosa’s CR17 campaign donors and the likes of China. Eskom is being used to strip national assets to be parcelled off to friends and business partners. Eskom is a state entity. Coal is a God given free commodity. Coal mining operations in South Africa are paid for by the state. Therefore, electricity should be free for household use. Households consume only 30% of the total energy produced by Eskom. Selling electricity for household use is nothing but daylight mugging of the people. Now the excuse of debt on a service which is already being paid for by the people is used to steal the land of the poor. Black First Land First (BLF) calls on Ramaphosa to stay out of the land of the poor. We also want to warn Eskom‘s prospective buyers that they must know that the land belongs to the people, and so too does Eskom. Eskom must stop irritating us and go after the R5 billion it has given to white monopoly capital by “mistake”.
