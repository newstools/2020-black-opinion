By Andile Mngxitama 1. The EFF and Unilever tell the media that the Unilever executive responsible for the racist ad has left the country. The media says nothing. It doesn’t ask EFF or Unilever to explain how is that possible because it would be a crime if anyone left the country under lockdown.
2. Ace Magashule joins a government delegation through a state aircraft on state duties – see what the Sunday Times writes: “Under level 2, the country borders remain closed and ordinary citizens such as Magashule, who does not hold a government post, can travel out of the country only after obtaining permission from authorities to do so”. No questions were asked about how the racist criminal Unilever exec has left the country. EFF didn’t ask nor has the media. And the law enforcement agencies pretend that the law has not been broken. We won’t let this go away. BLF has written to Unilever. We shall announce further actions tommorrow.
Point is, see how they question Ace but are silent on the Unilever exec whose name we still don’t know. Hypocrites! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
