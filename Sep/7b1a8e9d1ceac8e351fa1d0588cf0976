It’s Biko Day! 43 years later Steve Biko Lives! Black First Land First (BLF) is an orthodox Black Consciousness (BC) organization which insists on the application of Biko’s BC in its purest form because it represents a leap forward from the bowels of black nationalism that sprung from the first encounter between white oppression and black resistance. BLF doesn’t hold commemoration events on June 16 and 12 September out of respect and recognition for the older Black Consciousness Movement components in South Africa (SA). We recognize that it was formations like the Azanian People’s Organization (AZAPO), and comrades like Tiyani Lybon Mabasa of the Socialist Party of Azania (SOPA); Dr Aubrey Mokoape (former leader in SASO and BPC, and close friend and comrade of Biko) – who kept the memory of Biko alive at great cost to themselves and their families. BLF therefore doesn’t organize events that may compete with these older BC formations. It remains the hope of BLF that all the BC organizations shall unite and provide the much needed leadership to our people. Twenty six years after the the advent of democracy Biko is vindicated. SA is not liberated because it has abandoned the BC philosophy which puts blacks first. BLF also notes the continued assault on the memory of Biko by the Steve Biko Foundation. This time around they have invited a self confessed FBI impimpi, Reverend Al Sharpton, to soil the name of Biko. Biko lives!
