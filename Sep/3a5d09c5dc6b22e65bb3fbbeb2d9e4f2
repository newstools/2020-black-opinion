By Andile Mngxitama I believe that the ruling class (white monopoly capital) in South Africa (SA) is aware that a revolutionary situation is brewing. The oppressed youth and the starving black working class are restless. The ongoing open corruption of capital with the help of the Ramaphosa administration is mobilizing anger for a possible anti systemic explosion. The economy has just shrunk significantly in the last quarter with no prospects of growth in the foreseeable future. The pressure will mount for changeâ€¦. A part of the response of the ruling class is to create profitable diversions. To this end the angry youth are mobilized to let off steam by protest and subsequently given fake victories as white monopoly capital (WMC) smiles all the way to the bank. Johann Rupert knows the game too well. Racism is South Africa. Racism is not some offensive individual acts. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
