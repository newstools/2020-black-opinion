By Andile Mngxitama Please note: people who were politicized by the ANC into non racialism and the Freedom Charter do not understand what racism and white supremacy are. They generally confuse attitudes and bad manners with racism. They then formulate responses based on this wrong understanding of racism. They have no understanding at all of the institutional basis of individual acts of racism. To these people, racism is whites behaving badly. We can’t fight racism when we don’t know what it is. Steve Biko has thought about almost all the problems we are facing as black people and provided guidance on how we get out of this hell created by white people who arrived here in 1652. Without Biko’s Black Consciousness (BC) you are as good as a blind person. 12th September is the day Biko was certified as having passed on. He was assassinated by the government of white people. Yesterday I gave a talk on the lessons from Steve Biko. Let’s say it’s a BC for Beginners.
