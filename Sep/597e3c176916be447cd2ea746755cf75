By Andile Mngxitama Forget the gimmicks: check this…. The South African economy has shrunk some 51%. Over 3 million workers have lost their jobs adding to the 10 million unemployed. R500 billion has been given to white monopoly capital (WMC). The people are starving. The state is indifferent and politicians are playing games. This is a crisis that creates a revolutionary situation. In the immediate term those who are organized do not want a revolution and those who want a revolution are not sufficiently organized. Without a revolutionary movement the crisis may be internally directed and the poor pitted against each other. We shall see more diversions in the coming consecutive weeks. What are the immediate demands to turn this neoliberal crisis into a revolutionary crisis? This is the question revolutionaries must ask… The fight must be taken to the real enemy of liberation. Ramaphosa must go! WMC must fall!
WHAT MUST BE DONE? It’s an urgent question Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
