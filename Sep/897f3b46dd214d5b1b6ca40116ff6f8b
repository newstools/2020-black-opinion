The artists arrested for engaging in a peaceful protest on the N3 in Durban last Wednesday will appear in court today. Black First Land First (BLF) calls on the government of Cyril Ramaphosa to drop all charges against the artists. These artists are not criminals. They are being starved as the government gives all the Covid-19 relief funds to white monopoly capital (WMC). BLF stands with the artists. Why are those who stole the Covid-19 funds not arrested? The artists didnâ€™t commit any acts of corruption. They committed no crime. BLF demands that the government withdraws all charges against the artists and listens to their legitimate grievances. Artists are not criminals!
