Image credit: Twitter @_TakaBusi By Andile Mngxitama Early Saturday morning Yonela Boli, a student of Fort Hare University, was allegedly killed by his girlfriend at the campus residence after an argument between the two. She had stabbed the fellow before. Blacks are at war against themselves. Unlike the UCT/Wits course pack for feminists, we don’t have the luxury of easy condemnations and demonization. This war is structural and all are victims here. We murder 20 000 blacks a year, 16 000 of which are young black men. You call them oppressors? Steve Biko long identified the source of this mayhem. It’s the invisible hand of white supremacy causing havoc in the black community. One black student will be buried; another will be going to jail. Two lives destroyed by senseless violence in the black zone. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
