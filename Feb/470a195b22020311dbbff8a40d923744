President Jacob Zuma welcomed by a huge crowd of supporters at the OR Tambo International Airport yesterday By Andile Mngxitama White monopoly capital (WMC) media is busy since last night trying to reverse the truth of how much President Jacob Zuma is loved by the masses. They are giving the impression that a small group of people were at OR Tambo International Airport yesterday to welcome President Zuma upon his return from Cuba where he had received medical care. Reference is made for instance to a “group of people” and “[a] number of them” gathering at O.R. Tambo International Airport. Today the Sunday Times reports that there were “about 100” people to welcome President Zuma. I think I will write to the Press Ombudsman to demand a correction of this misrepresentation of facts. Really now. They lie openly! Just this feature image of one section of the crowd is over 100 people. President Zuma received a rousing revolutionary welcome yesterday, one befitting the father of radical economic transformation (RET). #HandsOffZuma #ArrestDeKlerk Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
