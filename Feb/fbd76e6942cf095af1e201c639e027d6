By Andile Mngxitama Did you know that 6 independent and credible investigations found that there is a rogue unit at the South African Revenue Service (SARS) and that it was unlawful? The Black Perspective goes live on my Facebook Page (Andile Mngxi) tonight 9 February at 21:00. Do tune in. I will be breaking it down for you as I explain, amongst other related things, the link between the Rogue Unit and the unlawful early retirement of Pravin Gordhanâ€™s friend, the former Deputy Commissioner of SARS, Ivan Pillay. There was general lawlessness under the Trevor Manuel and Gordhan rule at SARS and Treasury at the relevant time. We will join the dots up to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). See you later! #TheBlackPerspective Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
