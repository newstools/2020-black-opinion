Vukani Community Development Chairperson, Mayibuye Melisizwe Mandela The attempt by both the speaker and the DA to remove the Public Protector demonstrates a desperate plot by both to further disregard the rules of parliament, our constitution and the rule of law. The removal rule makes no provision for dealing with complainant MPs with a conflict of interest. Any of the ministers or MPs who are currently under investigation by the Public Protector or have had adverse findings made against them cannot participate in a committee set up by parliament to decide on the Public Protector’s impeachment as they have a conflict of interest. Political parties are the main complainants before the Public Protector and some have been quite vociferous in their condemnation of her issuing reports and remedial orders which did not suit their political agendas. Some parties like the DA are currently involved in litigation against the Public Protector. Should they then be allowed to envoke the section 194 removal enquiry to deal with matters in which they were unsuccessful litigants or in matters still pending judicial decision? The rules are unsurprisingly deafeningly silent from this regard! The speaker, the DA, the president of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa as well as some members of the executive including minister Pravin Gordhan are thus highly conflicted on the issue of the removal of the Public Protector as they have review applications pending against them before the courts with the Public Protector. This evidently makes the approval by the speaker to start proceedings for the removal of the Public Protector; an irrational, unconstitutional and complete disregard of the “Sub Judice” rule by parliament.
