Former president FW de Klerk. Image credit: thesouthafrican.com Black First Land First (BLF) welcomes Advocate Dali Mpofu’s call to revoke the Noble Peace Prize of the alleged mass murderer FW de Klerk. BLF already launched a process in 2018 to revoke the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to de Klerk. To this end on 26 March 2018, BLF wrote to the Nobel Foundation giving reasons why the Nobel Peace Prize must be withdrawn. BLF is pleased to see that Advocate Mpofu has now joined the call made by it to get the Nobel Peace Prize returned. Over and above the revocation call, BLF calls on Advocate Mpofu to also endorse its campaign to have de Klerk arrested. BLF pressed 22 charges against de Klerk in 2017 (see A, B, C). It’s important that de Klerk gets arrested and be made to pay for all the crimes he committed against black people in South Africa.
