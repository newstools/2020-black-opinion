By Andile Mngxitama Confession: I treat the services of mainstream medical practices (Big Pharma linked western medicine) with the same level of confidence that I treat the products of Pakistani/Somali spazashops. Two weeks ago I was not feeling well. I drove up to the door of a GP and couldn’t get the courage to get a check up. I called my homeopath instead. I had the same problem the other day when I wanted to buy some milk. I just couldn’t get the courage to buy it from a Pakistani spaza. We are in deep trouble for real. Poisoned by the food we eat; poisoned even further by the medicines we are given. We can’t trust anybody – from priest to politician. It’s time to develop proper knowledge systems of health and food, as a path to making revolution to end the evil system of profits by all costs. They are cashing in on our vulnerabilities, most of which are created by them to start of with. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
