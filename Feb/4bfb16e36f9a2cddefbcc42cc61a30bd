By Andile Mngxitama These black youth are hired by the racist Democratic Alliance (DA) funded Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa). They staged a protest of 6 outside the Pretoria High Court today. I learnt later that they had hurled insults at Mom Myeni as she walked into court to defend herself against Outa’s false allegations of her mismanaging the SAA during her tenure as chairperson. I arrived a little later after that incident. As I walked to court I saw the group and slowed down. I read their big banner. It said “Arrest state capture suspects” or something like that. I slowed down even furher because to me white monopoly capital is the state capturer. My instincts said “these are our comrades”. My mind said, “paid vigilante group.” My black consciousnesses later said, “hungry unemployed black children.” But before all that, in that moment when I slowed down I noticed the small group in slow motion with a banner and a big SA flag – in my mind, the SA flag is a symbol of apartheid. At that moment my eyes locked with one of the black boys. A smile spreads across his face. A black power fist forms. He quickly half shows it. He lip-synched, “AMANDLA COMRADE.” I shoot a black love smile back. A black power fist forms involuntarily with my hand. I don’t raise it. He knows I know. I walk. I want to cry. Our children are hungry and the enemy is turning them against themselves. We have failed the black child. Even now as I write this, bile comes up and I have a migraine. We failed them… No they aren’t the enemy…. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
