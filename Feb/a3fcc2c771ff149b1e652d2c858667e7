Tshwane China Mall By Andile Mngxitama South Africa (SA) is the only country on earth which allows foreigners (Chinese in particular) to come and build Malls in the country. We are a joke. Right now in Soweto the Chinese are building a ‘China Mall’ and aren’t employing people from Soweto. And some very “clever blacks” are saying that it’s all okay to allow the Chinese to bring their own labour and goods; and hire non South Africans to sell us (South Africans) foreign goods, because there are China Malls in the USA and in Europe. I think these blacks are sick. Really. Moreover these foreigners pay our political leaders some money to say that such nonsense is Pan Afrikanism. No it’s not. It’s super exploitation. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
