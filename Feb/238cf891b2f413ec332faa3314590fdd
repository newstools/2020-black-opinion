We are the devil incarnate and a trash deserving of no sympathy. The white feminism of UCT/Wits has now implanted the idea that to care for women means to hate specifically the black man. We must accept that this is the dominant thinking right now. Its essence is to actually absolve whiteness as the central organizing structure that creates general violence in the black zone. 20 000 blacks get murdered annually. 16 000 are young black men and it’s not a crisis at all. “Let them die!” – seems to be the national consensus. Anyone speaking for the black man is a misogynistic patriachal pig!
We have to break the silence. We have to return to a wholestic frame of analysis that understands the black condition from a black perspective. Blacks are dying… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
