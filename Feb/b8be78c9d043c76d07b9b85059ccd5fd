By Andile Mngxitama Julius Malema says that his party is going to mobilize for President Zuma because he must not serve time due to his advanced age. This contradicts his declaration last year, namely: “elect me I will arrest Zuma”. There are a number of things happening but the key is self preservation. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) must be ready to move. Would the use of the NPA by Pravin Jamnandas Girdhan lead to a reconciliation of Juju with uBaba to get protection? Juju would do anything to stay out of jail. The only question for us is this: if this pans out to be true, would it advance radical economic transformation (RET)? Let’s put this question differently: how do we use such a scenario to advance RET? Vladimir Lenin teaches us that, ‘[a] scoundrel may be of use because he is a scoundrel”. He cautions never to forget that these people are scoundrels because they are going to stab you in the back as soon as they are in the clear. Watch this space… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
