By Andile Mngxitama I spoke to journalists at the results operations centre of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) after the national elections last year. I told them that Black First Land First (BLF) rejects the elections. I pointed out that lots of our votes were stolen, hence we can’t concede defeat. I also indicated that despite BLF’s votes being stolen, it’s ALUTA! I sincerely thanked those who voted for us. The final tally was about 20 000 votes that the IEC couldn’t steal.
