By Andile Mngxitama “In Cost-Plus contracts Eskom pays for operating costs plus a pre-determined return-on-investment with mines owned by the coal miner. In general, long-term contracts are approximately 40 years….” – Matshela Koko Motherfuckers before you waste my time with your stupid “I beg to differ, electricity can’t be free” NYWENYWE BULLSHIT, at least do your homework. Just go and look up “COST PLUS MINES”, PLEASE!!! I’m so tired of the amount of stupidity I have to encounter. I do my homework. May those who differ at least respect me and do the same? How much more must I put a factual argument up and be subjected to the continued stupidity of these morons. I’m speaking to the sleeping fools. If reason and logic can’t wake them up, let’s try a harsher method. Do you know that Jesus Christ went into a temple and moered some people? Nothing wrong with awakening the sleeping with a klap. I never said I’m the Pope. I shall sjambok to consciousnesses those who refuse to see the truth when presented to them. It’s my righteous rage against ignorance. I have a huge responsibility to educate and I’m also being educated myself… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
