By Andile Mngxitama The problem with Facebook is that you get super energetic self assured morons “engaging” you on subjects they know fokol about. Long time ago, we had an intellectual group call Mvusa Circle led by Dr Windsor Leroke – I will write about it more another time. Anyway there was a chap who never did the required readings but always asked stupid questions. He had energy to keep interrupting and asking his dumb questions. Kgafela oa Magogodi was so fed up that he summoned some of us to a lunch meeting one time and said in the next discussion we must ask Mr Energetic Moron to speak for the first 30 minutes and ask and say whatever and then he will be told to shut up for the rest of the session. How much one wishes one could do the same with Facebook morons. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
