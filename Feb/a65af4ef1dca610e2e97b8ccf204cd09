Former South African Airways board chairperson, Ms Dudu Myeni. Image: BO archives. The ongoing court application to have the former the South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson, Ms Dudu Myeni, declared a delinquent director is nothing but harassment by the Democratic Alliance (DA) funded Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa). Outa was founded by White Monopoly Capital (WMC) to fight its opponents through the court. Vukani Community Development denounces the unrelenting onslaught on Ms Myeni. Ms Myeni is being attacked because she wanted transformation at the SAA where up to 98% of the annual procurement budget, which runs into billions, goes to white companies Ms Myeni wanted to stop the systemic corruption of mostly white pilots whose luxurious life sponsored by the SAA is one of the biggest wasteful expenditure points. Itâ€™s not Ms Myeni who should be on the stand but rather Coleman Andrews who is the main creator of the SAA crisis. He sold the SAA fleet of airplanes and then leased it back to the national carrier. Billions in bailouts are used to pay these leases. Why is Andrews not in court to account for the over R200 million he gave himself for work of less than 2 years? The nation heard yesterday how Ms Myeni wanted a good deal from Emirates. She is punished for defending the national interests. Why are foreign airlines allowed in the SA domestic space? Issued by the Board of Vukani Community Development
