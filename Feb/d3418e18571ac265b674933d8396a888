By Andile Mngxitama So you get a taxify. The driver has already gotten himself some McDonald’s burger etc. He is eating and his stash is on the front seat. The car suffocates you with GMO fumes the moment you step inside and he is also happily slurping on a big coke. You ask him to open the window. He says he has air con. You are in no mood for all this because you are thinking about the arrogance of Pravin and others and how they are abusing state power. So you endure an air con that you don’t want whilst engulfed in a McDonald’s GMO gas chamber. Suffer Afrika… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
