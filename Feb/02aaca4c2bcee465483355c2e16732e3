Derek Hanekom. Gallo Images By Andile Mngxitama Madiba appointed Derek Hanekom as Minister of Land Affairs and gave him a clear mandate to return 30% of the land to blacks in five years (1994 to 1999). Hanekom did none of the things he was appointed for. He instead hired all his white friends into senior positions including Geoff Budlender as Director-General and Jean du Plessis as the Land Restitution Chief Director. They sabotaged any progress towards land redress. After 5 years only less than 1% was bought back by the government. Mind you, 6% of the land exchange hands annually between whites. Hanekom then put the blame on Ntate Joe Seremane who had nothing to do with the shenanigans of white liberals betraying the vision of Nelson Mandela. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
