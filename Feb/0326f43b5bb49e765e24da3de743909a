By Andile Mngxitama Yesterday I’m in a mall rocking my BLF t-shirt. As I walk peacefully, a white man taps my shoulder from the back. I turn and meet whiteness. Whiteness complains and threatens at the same time – the t-shirt is intimidating him and if things go on like this there would be war. I told the land thief to fuck off to Holland. I keep walking. I’m at the till paying. The land thief comes to me and says he’s there to apologize but I too must apologize. I don’t have my okapi. I look around. I see a well developed chair. I repeat my response in BLF proper colorful language. Security jumps between us. I tell him he is no longer welcome here, he must fuck off to Holland for good. Moral of the story: most white people, even those who don’t have land are prepared to defend the land theft of their relatives. The BLF t-shirt must come with a warning: NOT for those not ready to fight! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
