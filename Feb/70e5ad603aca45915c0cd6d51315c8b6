The people instinctively know who the friends of the revolution are. After the event many ANC comrades asked to take pictures. We were sincerely welcomed. Some comrades were clear that Black First Land First (BLF) must become an alliance partner of the ANC because they no longer trust the South African Communist Party (SACP) and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU). We are united with the progressive current of the ANC by our common support for radical economic transformation (RET). I hope all organizations of the people can adopt RET. It’s a minimum program to unite us against the primary enemy which is white monopoly capital (WMC). We know that right now the ANC is governed by the Stellenbosch faction. There will be no progress at all until that faction is removed. We need to build a strong independent BLF which must have the capacity to force the ANC into a Black Agenda. In conclusion, anyone who says that s/he is fighting WMC but is not defending President Zuma is a liar and a con. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
