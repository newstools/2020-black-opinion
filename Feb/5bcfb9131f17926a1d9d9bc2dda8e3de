By Andile Mngxitama What a befitting welcome for President Jacob Zuma… Black First Land First (BLF) was there at the O.R. Tambo Airport today to welcome the father of Radical Economic Transformation (RET). The RET forces welcomed BLF with love and solidarity. We are one on RET. The push back against Stellenbosch is gaining momentum. Many many beautiful moments… The PA system failed us. However, our presence was enough. I repeat, the love the ordinary members of the African National Congress (ANC) have for BLF is overwhelming. We return the favor. And oh, Supra can sing shem…. #HandsoffZuma #arrestDeKlerk Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
