Dudu Myeni, former board chairperson of SAA. Image: BO archives State institutions meant to protect every citizen are used to persecute those considered hostile to white monopoly capital (WMC). Ms Dudu Myeni, the former board chairperson of the South African Airways (SAA), is facing a well funded and well coordinated judicial attack by forces of reaction. The white right wing groups masked as civil society entities are using the untransformed courts to stop the program of Radical Economic Transformation (RET). Dudu Myeni is being persecuted for wanting change at SAA. The nation still doesn’t know that the source of the SAA crisis is a white American man called Coleman Andrews who took over R200 million for himself after selling off aircrafts belonging to the national carrier to his friends and promptly allowing them to be leased back to the SAA. It’s the height of hypocrisy that Dudu Myeni is in court and Coleman Andrews is enjoying the loot he got from the SAA. Black First Land First (BLF) will be submitting a complaint of state capture, by Coleman Andrews and his gang, to the Zondo Commission.
