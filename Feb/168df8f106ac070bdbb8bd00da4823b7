By Andile Mngxitama It’s a stupid question. No one has done anything for black people. We are all still oppressed. And there is no messiah coming to help blacks. Black people come to Black First Land First (BLF) with many problems. We do what we can, but we often can’t help them because we have no means etc. In the last few days, I have been working with a group of blacks who are being muscled out of a monopolistic industry. People are losing jobs and small businesses are shutting down. So I understood that the company I was helping was not at least 51% black owned. So i explained that BLF will only assist a level 1 BEE company. So we worked on this. I’m happy to say that I just got a call. “Leader, we are now majority shareholders”, I’m told. I say, “congratulations!” Now the fight is in full scale. We don’t help anyone. We aren’t Jesus. We struggle together with those who are ready to fight! Land Or Death!
