Photo taken at the OR Tambo Airport yesterday during the arousing welcoming event for President Zuma who was returning from Cuba after receiving medical treatment there. By Andile Mngxitama These are radical economic transformation (RET) forces from the Free State. They were giving me progress report on my comrade Lenyehelo Lenyehelo who has since joined the African National Congress (ANC) as the advanced force of radical black nationalism. I told them we don’t recognize the post 1955 ANC of Joe Slovo and other racists like bo Ben Turok. Anyway we agree on one thing – RET IS THE MINIMUM PROGRAM. #HandsOffZuma
