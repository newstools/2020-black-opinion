By Andile Mngxitama “When you walk into a fight between a black and a white person, you don’t ask questions; you help the black to defeat the white and ask questions after the fight” – this is BC101. It is one of the most important principles of Black Consciousness (BC). But we need to operationalize it into an everyday guide. BC must guide us ALL THE TIME. Let’s apply the principle to what happened today: Derek Hanekom decides to put up a fight on behalf of the Stellenbosch mafia. He targets Duduzane Zuma.
I then bring in Hanekom’s betrayal of Nelson Mandela so as to focus our fire on him and to get societal sympathy against a man who betrayed Mandela. Now the BC principle should have guided you to at once understand the line of march. In this situation you are expected to suspend your issues with Mandela and open fire on Hanekom the settler. Many of us failed to apply this principle today. We ended up spending all our energy on Mandela and thereby became the defenders of Hanekom by default. This is very important. We got to be on our BC feet all the time. Hope this helps… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
