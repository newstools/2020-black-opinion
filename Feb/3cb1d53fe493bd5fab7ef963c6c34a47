Former president FW de Klerk. Image credit: Loanna Hoffmann Black First Land First (BLF) gives the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) one month to arrest the war criminal FW de Klerk, failing which we shall take their matter to the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights. In 2017 BLF opened 22 criminal charges against de Klerk. These included the January 12, 1991 Sebokeng massacre where more than 30 black people were killed; the June 17, 1992 Boipatong massacre that claimed 45 lives; also the October 8, 1993 killing of five children in Transkei. BLF will also investigate the possibility of a private prosecution of FW de Klerk for these heinous crimes. He didn’t apply for nor get amnesty from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) for these crimes. BLF will continue to fight for justice and resist the cheapening of the cause through opportunistic stunts as we saw in the State of the Nation Address (SONA) in parliament last night. The people who were applauding FW de Klerk at the 2018 SONA and booed former President Jacob Zuma are now claiming to fight de Klerk. It’s all about deflecting attention from the looting of the VBS Mutual Bank and other corrupt activities. De Klerk must be brought to book!
