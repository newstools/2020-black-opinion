Ideologically parliament is essentially one. It’s family disagreements that we are seeing, both figuratively and literally. Parliament is all performance and no substance. The effect of it is to give Ramaphosa a free pass to implement the Stellenbosch agenda. No substantial and ideologically grounded criticism of the SONA has been given thus far. Ramaphosa dribbled all and threw the bones of the state bank and the national sovereignty fund. These proposals are in synch with the Stellenbosch agenda. We are in trouble. The African National Congress (ANC) is too weak in parliament. No gravitas. No dynamism. They are intellectually flat footed. Any determined howler can disorganise them. Their worst weakness is the lack of a progressive agenda and revolutionary temperament. As a consequence what you have is a browl of different factions of the same neocolonial nonsense controlled from London and Stellenbosch. It’s a disaster for black people. Even their insults lack creativity. The asparagus people! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
