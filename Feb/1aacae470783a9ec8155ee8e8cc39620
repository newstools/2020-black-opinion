US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Photo credit: The Zimbabwe Mail Black First Land First (BLF) calls on the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to stay out of South Africaâ€™s internal affairs. South Africa (SA) is not a 53rd state of the USA. BLF views the statements made by Pompeo on Land Expropriation Without Compensation (LEWC) as acts of imperialist aggression. LEWC shall happen irrespective of the bullying tactics of the USA. BLF calls on parliament to stop playing games and to ensure that the land is returned to black people without further delays. Should parliament fail to return our land, BLF shall then embark on full scale land occupations to redress the colonial land theft. Pompeo must worry about paying reparations for slavery and stop the ongoing mass killings of black people in the USA.
