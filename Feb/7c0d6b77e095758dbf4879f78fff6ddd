By Andile Mngxitama When you fully come to Black Consciousness (BC), you stop the conditional defence of black people who are under attack by white power. The conditional support is a luxury of people who don’t know yet that white supremacy doesn’t need any reason to lynch black people. In the Black First Land First (BLF) ‘Black Code On Sellouts’, we explain all this.  That’s why I find it tragic and laughable when some say that we can’t defend Kobe Bryant becuase he supposedly had a sexual relationship with a white woman. If we do this, then no black person deserves to be defended. Which black person in this white world has not in one way or the other done something we disapprove of? We defend ALL BLACK PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDER ATTACK BY WHITE POWER, even those who hate us. We do this because we know that once the enemy is done with them, it’s coming for US!
