By Andile Mngxitama President Jacob Zuma is a symbol of resistance against white monopoly capital (WMC). Only those not involved in the battle or those on the side of the enemy would say otherwise. The fight today is simply radical economic transformation (RET) versus Stellenbosch.
Ret is symbolically represented by President Zuma, while Cyril Ramaphosa and Pravin Gordhan represent Stellenbosch. We need to deepen our understanding of what RET is. I was approached by a few African National Congress (ANC) branch leaders who asked if I could come and address them on RET. I agreed to do so. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
