President Jacob Zuma. Picture credit: cogta.gov.za By BO Staff Writer Earlier today Parliament confirmed that President Zuma will attend the State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Thursday. Zuma’s attorneys subsequently issued a statement confirming that their client did receive an invitation to the SONA and that the Director-General in the Presidency had been advised that he will not be attending the event. They indicated that they had no knowledge “how and where Parliament obtained this incorrect information.” They  clarified that “President Zuma is currently receiving medical treatment in a foreign country, and will, therefore, not be attending the Sona.” Black First Land First (BLF) President, Andile Mngxitama, accused Parliament of deliberately lying so as to gain the opportunity to attack him via the media. Once their objective was attained they withdrew their lies under the guise that they had been mistaken. “Liars!!! Parliament of pathological liars. They just wanted to give the media another platform to attack Zuma”, Mngxitama said on social media.
