By Andile Mngxitama I have noticed that the children of Mahatma Gandhi (Indians who hate Africans) and the children of Hendrik Verwoerd (ypepo), all support the death penalty and all hate President Zuma. They are irritating. In their minds the death penalty will kill Africans because it’s Africans who are criminals. Never forget what Ghandi said about Africans. You see Gandhi’s ideas living through Pravin Gordhan in how he treats Africans. It’s called Indian Consciousness. it’s the junior partner of White Supremacy. Ghandi helped the British against the Africans and then cried tears when they forgot to give him chocolate. There were Indians who chose to be Black, like the late Strini Moodley who was a close friend of Steve Biko. Strini rejected Indian Consciousness for Black Consciousness. Anyway even on my Twitter feed, it’s the anti black children of Ghandi in alliance with the children of Verwoerd who troll me a lot. #BlackSermons Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
