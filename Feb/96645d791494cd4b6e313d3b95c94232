By Andile Mngxitama You Reds of London are angry with me for pointing out your hypocrisy and opportunism. There is no difference between FW de Klerk praising apartheid and Helen Zille praising colonialism. Zille is indeed an unrepentant supporter of colonialism but you are so cool with her. You even give her political power and call her the better devil. You applauded FW de Klerk and booed Jacob Zuma. And then a year later, for reasons only known by you, you suddenly get angry at de Klerk. What has changed? I’m just pointing out your inconsistencies. You can’t be angry at me. Fix yourself. I’m helping you. Greetings to all the blacks who are not hypocrites and opportunists. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
