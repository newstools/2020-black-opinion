By Andile Mngxitama In war you need strategic inflexibility and tactical flexibility, or you are going to shoot yourself in the foot. In my previous status update today, (“Did you know that Derek Hanekom betrayed Nelson Mandela?”), I make a tactical move to help us fight against a clear and present danger – Derek Hanekom. I use the stature of Nelson Mandela to put Hanekom on the firing line as a traitor. I use Madiba the Saint to show how he was betrayed by Hanekom. This idea was to put the moral weight of Mandela on Hanekom. About 80% of the responses are then directed at Madiba. Moreover these responses focused on why Mandela gave Hanekom the responsibility of land. Mandela was also accused of selling out. Those that commented in this regard thereby became defenders of Hanekom de facto. I had put Hanekom at the center because he is our current problem. Comrades allowed their anger against Madiba to let the immediate dangerous target off the hook. If blacks don’t learn the art of war we are guaranteed to lose battles for the next 1000 years.
