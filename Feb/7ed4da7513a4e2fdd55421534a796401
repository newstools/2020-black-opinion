Former South African President FW de Klerk. Photo credit: Polity Black First Land First (BLF) calls on the National Prosecution Authority (NPA) and the Hawks to arrest and prosecute FW de Klerk. On May 8, 2017 BLF laid 22 criminal charges against FW de Klerk regarding cases of mass murders relating to several massacres. Arrest and prosecute FW de KlerkDe Klerk didn’t appear before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) to make confessions regarding his sins. He has no immunity from prosecution. We demand justice for the thousands of people murdered by his apartheid regime. We note that white monopoly capital (WMC) is going all out to use the captured judiciary to lynch both Dudu Myeni and the Public Protector (PP) Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane. We also note that Ramaphosa’s ANC, is dealing with all the other Radical Economic Transformation (RET) forces, to satisfy the CR17 donors. In this context the legal system continues to prosecute black people while white criminals, charged by BLF, get to walk the streets freely. BLF will be approaching the NPA to get clarity as to why de Klerk has not yet been arrested and prosecuted and shall take appropriate action for its failure to do its work.
