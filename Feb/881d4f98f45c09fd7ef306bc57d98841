He recalled that after the U.S. withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 2002 and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 2019, Washington had rejected Moscow’s proposal to declare a moratorium on the creation and deployment of intermediate-range missiles. The United States plans to deploy medium- and shorter-range missiles in the Asia-Pacific region, Lavrov said. He also said that Russia has repeatedly proposed extending the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), which expires next year. If it comes to multilateral negotiations on the New START in which everyone agrees to participate, of course, Russia will also be part of this process, Lavrov said. Reposted from telesurenglish
