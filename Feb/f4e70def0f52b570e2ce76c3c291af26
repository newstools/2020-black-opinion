BY Andile Mngxitama FW de Klerk says that apartheid was not a “crime against humanity”. Helen Zille says “For those claiming legacy of colonialism was ONLY negative, think of our independent judiciary, transport infrastructure, piped water”. For the Reds of London, Zille is the better devil. How? For them she is so better that she can be given political power in the metros. There is something deeply rotten with playing political games with our bitter history. There is something evil with populist stunts to deflect attention from the real problems of our people. Without ideology you clap for everything… It’s infuriating! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
