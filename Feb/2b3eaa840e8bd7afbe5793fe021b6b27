Photo credit: Russell Roberts By BO Staff Writer Dudu Myeni, the former the South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson, is at the High Court in Pretoria today in a case instituted by the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) and the SA Pilots Association who seek an order declaring her a delinquent director. They accuse Myeni of mismanaging the national carrier during her tenure as chairperson. Two erstwhile SAA executives gave testimony regarding two deals that they allege would have benefited SAA, namely a deal of R1.5 billion with Emirates; and another deal associated with procuring 5 Airbus A330 aircraft. Outa claims that the SAA sustained losses amounting to about R17 billion due to Myeni’s mismanagement of the airline. It also seeks an order for the referral of Myeni to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). Black First Land First (BLF) President, Andile Mngxitama, is in court today in support of Myeni. “Comrade Dudu Myeni is a victim of the attack of the DA on her via Outa. I can’t believe we as the black majority have allowed the DA via its proxy #Outa to harass a leader who has done a patriotic duty of defending our national interests.It’s hard to understand why Dudu Myeni is in court and treated like a criminal. Outa is funded by the DA and white monopoly capital,” Mngxitama said, taking to Facebook. “I’m more sad than angry that this is happening in this country today. Many black people and their leaders and organizations must really take a deep serious look at their role in demonizing people like Dudu Myeni. Irrespective of the truth that shows she is innocent, I have no confidence that the white court will be fair. We know the truth. We must defend it. Dudu Myeni is being persecuted for simply defending our national interests. It’s sad and tragic,” he explained Mngxitama also commented throughout the court proceedings via his Twitter account as can be gleaned from the images below:
