This follows the refusal by the court on the last occasion of his application for leave to appeal the court’s decision in terms of which the permanent stay of prosecution was denied. Zuma’s application for the stay of prosecution was based on the fact that the unreasonably long delay in starting the proceedings has compromised his right to a fair trial. He faces the said charges together with French arms company Thales, whose application for stay of prosecution was also denied. Andile Mngxitama, the President of Black First Land First (BLF), told Black Opinion that the charges against Zuma are part of a well coordinated campaign by powerful forces that entails the full scale judicial lynching of RET forces. “They are coming for all RET forces and those who voted for Cyril Ramaphosa must take responsibility for this mess”, he said.
