Former president FW de Klerk. Image credit: Thobile Mathonsi/African News Agency/ANA Black First Land First (BLF) shall be taking several concrete steps to bring FW de Klerk to justice. Amongst measures to be taken is to ask the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to indicate if it is not going to prosecute de Klerk for the 22 charges, including murder for the various massacres he committed, that BLF pressed against him in 2017. In the event of the NPA not prosecuting de Klerk, BLF will institute a private prosecution process against him. Furthermore, BLF has instructed its lawyers to lodge a complaint against de Klerk at the International Criminal Court (based in the Hague in Netherlands), of war crimes and crimes against humanity. BLF doesnâ€™t want empty talk and posturing. We want de Klerk to be held accountable. BLF is appalled by organizations and individuals such as the Desmond Tutu Foundation, the South African Council of Churches, and former President Thabo Mbeki who continue to give de Klerk the benefit of the doubt and try to coerce him into superficially apologizing so that no action is taken against him. BLF believes that only those black entities with a sick mind and suffering from acute mental slavery would ask a former apartheid president to acknowledge the humanity of black people. Apartheid, like colonialism, is essentially about denying the humanity of black people. BLF wants individual apartheid leaders prosecuted and institutional reparations for victims, which is essentially land return to black people. Only these measures will bring a semblance of justice.
