President Ramaphosa. Image credit: African News Agency(ANA) By BO Staff Writer Last week some white owned media such as Media24 were given new evidence by whistleblowers. This evidence proves beyond doubt that Cyril Ramaphosa deliberately lied to parliament when he said that he didn’t know the day to day functioning of the CR17 campaign. It proves that Ramaphosa lied when he was asked about the R500 000 donation from Bosasa. The lies Ramaphosa told parliament are so grave that they threaten his Presidency. Ramaphosa got to power bankrolled by the R1 billion donated to the CR17 campaign by white monopoly capital (WMC). Bosasa gave R500 000 via Ramaphosa’s son Andile Ramaphosa to the CR17 campaign. The Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, has found that the CR17 campaign funds may have been sourced through unlawful means, including through money laundering. Black First Land First (BLF) has opened criminal charges against Ramaphosa for corruption; bribery; fraud; money laundering; and tax evasion in this respect. On his part Ramaphosa has offered the explanation that he didn’t know what was happening in the CR17 campaign. He kept at arms length. This we now know is a lie. The white owned media has new evidence that he lied. This new evidence is being suppressed in the hope that it doesn’t add to the woes of Ramaphosa. This shows that the media in South Africa is nothing but a tool of WMC. BLF has said it will write to the SANEF asking it to clarify its position on whether deliberate suppression of evidence is ethical journalism. The black consciousnesses organization has also said that it will raise the same issue with the Speaker of the National Assembly, Thandi Modise.
