By Andile Mngxitama Today the #BLF26 will appear in court in Pretoria. Our matter was thrown out after 2 years of court proceedings. The Ramaphosa administration has unleashed an Afrikaner NPA prosecutor to draft new charges on the same facts against us. We are now charged under an apartheid 1953 piece of legislation. Our sin was a peaceful demonstration at the office of the former Public Protector, Thuli Mandonsela, to demand that she investigates the R26 billion stolen from the Reserve Bank by the likes of ABSA, Johann Rupert and others as well as state capture by white monopoly capital (WMC). We all know that the current Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, is in trouble for finding that ABSA must pay back the money. After Mkhwebaneâ€˜s finding, BLF successfully led a series of protest actions. On 28 January 2017 we successfully occupied and picketed 50 ABSA outlets nationally towards recovery of the stolen billions; and on 17 February 2017 we undertook a march to SARB to pressurize it to compel ABSA to pay back the money. Anyway the key thing is that the Ramaphosa administration seeks to jail us using an apartheid law. Pravin Gordhan is vindictive. We know who runs the NPA. #HandsOffBLF26
