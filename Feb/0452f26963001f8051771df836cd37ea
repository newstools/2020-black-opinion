By Andile Mngxitama I was on SAFM yesterday at 15:10 explaining our call for free electricity for all. Some black people think I have lost my mind. I heard that a white man called SAFM after I was on. He said he prays that Black First Land First never gets to parliament. Them ypepo know the truth and them blacks are sleepin… I do sympathize with Masechaba. She would lose her job. Such truths are not allowed in South Africa. Some blacks are so brainwashed they now think talking black is madness. And oh boy, we are mad as hell! Cheepad bari!!! If you missed the interview yesterday, you may listen to the podcast, “Andile Mngxitama says electricity is a right and therefore South Africans must not pay”, here. SOWETO IS CORRECT, ELECTRICITY IS A RIGHT! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
