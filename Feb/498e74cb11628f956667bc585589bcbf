By Andile Mngxitama I hold that the prevailing ‘let’s hate Nelson Mandela’ fashion is a white power structure sponsored project. We criticized Mandela when he was alive when it was not fashionable. But this new fad is a diversion from the real enemy. Remember how, after meeting Robin Renwick, the Reds of London spread that message? Remember also how months earlier, these same people were celebrating Mandela? Blacks need to know that we are almost always manipulated. When Winnie Mandela died, the enemy made sure that we don’t focus on her legacy. They ensured that her death became about Mandela the sellout. Be warned, the enemy is always planning ahead. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
