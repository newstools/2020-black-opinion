Here is a man who took WMC head on and reactionaries were mobilized by it to demonise him. BLF leads! When others were applauding FW We Klerk, we were clear that he is a war criminal. We took action and announced “BLF has written to the Noble Peace Prize Committee to demand that it revokes the peace prize given to a mass murderer in 1993. We have asked the committee if it considers murdering black people part of its understanding of peace.” Today the Reds of London applaud de Klerk and the next day they claim to fight him… Let them follow because they have no ideology.
