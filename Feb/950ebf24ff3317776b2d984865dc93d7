By Andile Mngxitama So black people who claim to be revolutionary don’t know that apartheid is a baby of colonialism? Apartheid as a formal system was only implemented in 1948. Colonialism in South Africa (SA) starts in 1652 and by 1948 it had rendered blacks landless slaves. So when your anger is towards FW de Klerk but you are okay with the unrepentant colonialism praise singer Helen Zille – you either don’t know what time it is or you are just a hypocrite. De Klerk and Zille are in the same WhatsApp group. I will have to do a short lecture on what is colonialism and why it’s bad for blacks…. Yirrrrr…. jessusss…. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
