Adriaan Snyman, the man who handed Malema the gun. Photo credit: Afri News Agency (ANA) Black First Land First (BLF) laid criminal charges against Adriaan Snyman on August 2, 2018 relating to the gross negligent handling of a firearm. BLF also asked that a declaration of unfitness to possess a firearm in terms of the new Firearms Control Act must be made by the Court in relation to Snyman. The case, which was opened at the Hillbrow Police Station under the reference CAS 60/8/2018, was subsequently transferred to Mdantsane police station where a new reference was allocated, being CAS 28/8/2018. Snyman‘s conduct amounts to gross negligent handling of a firearm in that he gave the said firearm to Julius Malema to fire shots into the air (unsupervised) during a public event being the fifth birthday celebrations of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium, in Mdantsane. BLF believes that the non action of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) against Snyman shows it is biased and takes instructions from Afriforum. It is not Malema’s firearm. Even if it was a toy gun, as alleged, it was nonetheless handed to Malema by Snyman. To this end Snyman had endangered the lives of people at (and in the vicinity of) the EFF event. BLF is surprised that no action has been taken against Snyman. We call on the NPA to immediately take action.
