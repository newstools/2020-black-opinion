Photo credit: Duane Daws By Andile Mngxitama One of my happiest moments politically was when President Zuma fired Pravin Gordhan as Minister of Finance. I never thought Nxams would pull such a courageous revolutionary move. But he did. He had been testing the patience of the rand for a few days. After exhausting its volatility, he struck at the heart of white monopoly capital (WMC). We would do well to remember who stood in support of Pravin Gordhan. Today thumamina is making South Africa (SA) white again. The state is a tool and toy of Pravin Gordhan. The state has gone rogue, proper! Zuma tried to save us from this hell. Agents of London and Stellenbosch got rid of him. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
