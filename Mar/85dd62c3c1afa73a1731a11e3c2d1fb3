Regardless of the human costs that the economic blockade causes to the Venezuelan people, the U.S. Attorney General William Barr Thursday announced that his country will designate Venezuela as a state sponsoring terrorism. The U.S. State Department also announced indictments against President Nicolas Maduro and other Bolivarian officials, whom the President Donald Trump administration accuses of having ties to drug trafficking. Additionally, the U.S. government offers US$15 million for “any information leading to the arrest” of the Bolivarian president. A reward of US$10 million will be awarded to those who provide information for arresting the National Constituent Assembly (ANC) president Diosdado Cabello, Vice President Tareck El Aissami, former general Hugo Carvajal, and former military chief Cliver Alcala Cordones. To justify its arbitrary actions, the U.S. argues that Venezuela allowed the then Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) to use its national airspace to transport drugs and “flood the U.S with cocaine,” as the Southern District of New York Attorney Geoffrey Berman said.
