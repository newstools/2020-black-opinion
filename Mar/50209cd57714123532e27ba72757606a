President Cyril Ramaphosa President Ramaphosa continues with his haphazard and timid response to the Covid-19 pandemic. In his public address yesterday, Ramaphosa promised to deploy 10 000 field workers who would do door to door screening for symptoms of Covid-19. This is too little too late. What is required is mass testing! South Korea arrested the march of the virus through mass testing. The country was able to test 15 000 people a day, free of charge. This is testing not even screening. Black First Land First (BLF) has persistently asked for bold and decisive action. Turn the 23 000 voting stations into testing stations. Bring 50 000 healthcare workers in. It can be done. Added to these measures, give people food and provide financial relief for the informal sector. Itâ€™s time for decisive, bold actions.
