By Andile Mngxitama The virus is unleashed upon us. My mind and heart is at the taxi ranks, the bus stops, the train stations. Millions exposed yet again this morning. The stupid government has been dispatching the police to harass people to enforce the devil “1pm and 6pm no tavern” rule, but they are happy for us to die for profits. They said that we can’t worship if we are more than 100 people gathering, yet thousands are on the move mixing and possibly passing on the bug. My thoughts are also at the mines as thousands sink into the belly of the earth to dig out gold which enriches others. The dust. The cough. Soon it will be too late. 1 million of us will die. One more day is wasted. Ramaphosa has ran away. The opposition parties have self quarantined. The people are defenceless. We are repeating ourselves. Our voices are hoarse. Like Pharaoh, Stellenbosch won’t listen. When is Ramaphosa returning from Stellenbosch? Does he know there is Coronavirus and scientists say it may infect 1 million in 40 days? When he is back, please tell him to urgently #ShutdownSA and put serious measures in place to take care of the people, not capital. Or is he waiting for 60 to 70% of the people to get the virus? My God, we are leaderless in a time of a pandemic…. #ShutDownSA Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
