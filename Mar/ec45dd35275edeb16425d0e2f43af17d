By Andile Mngxitama The hurting of each other, the self destruction, the bad choices, the back stabbings, the betrayals, the lack of loyalty, the incapacity to sacrifice, the petty jealousies, the vindictiveness, are all symptoms of a people in pain. We are hurting and we hurt… We do need Black Love which is the supreme revolutionary act to realize Black Power and end all black suffering. We are in pain… One solution… REVOLUTION! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
