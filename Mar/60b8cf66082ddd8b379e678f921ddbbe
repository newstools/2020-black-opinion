By Andile Mngxitama I’m not opposed to the principle of “I believe her”, but im interested in how we implement it. We must have the conviction of our beliefs. The following considerations arise in the way that the principle is currently practiced: i. The complainant is a victim by vertue of saying so?
ii. The accused person is guilty because we believe the complainant?
iii. There is no place for the principle of “innocent until proven guilty”?
iv. The accused person must be fired from work and must be treated as a rapist without a court saying so?
v. What’s the role of courts, if any? If we mean an accusation is a sentence and that the accused is guilty until proven otherwise, let’s say so, so that there is no confusion and inconsistency in the treatment of accused persons. We can then look at what must happen to false accusations. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
