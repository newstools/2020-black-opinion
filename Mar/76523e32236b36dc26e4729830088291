By Andile Mngxitama Growing up, barely 16, we were already facing death and jail. I was reminded by someone about this the other day. Once I was assaulted badly because of a girl who visited and spoke English to me. I didn’t even know what hit me at that time. A tough guy called Mateu unleashed his muscles on me. We escaped. When we were at a safe distance crying with rage, my friend Mtheto Nkafu said we must go back and fight. I had just escaped Mateu’s punches and kicks, which almost killed me, and this guy says we must go back. I unleashed my rage on him. Lol… It became nasty. A month later, when my gang took revenge for my beating, Xhego got a broken jaw. His sin was to side with Mateu – he told me I deserved what I got. Incidentally, Xhego was my friend who believed that bicycles can hear human conversations. Anyway, I also remember that one time when my younger brother and I cornered a chap called Papiki and he fell. I aimed a full quart bottle of beer at his head with all my might. Thanks God I missed. And the school soccer trip to Carletonville is unforgettable. I remember seeing knives and fleeing school children… Black kids live with death. We were lucky… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
