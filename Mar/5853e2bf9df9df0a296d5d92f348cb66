By Andile Mngxitama I just saw a really confused attempt to use Black Consciousness (BC) and Pan Afrikanism to push the Rhodes/Wits/UCT demonization of the black man and his elevation into the enemy, in order to provide cover for white supremacy which causes havoc in the black zone. According to this white thinking, there is an irreconcilable antagonism between the black man and black woman. We must be careful of the white agenda that now proclaims itself BC and even Pan Afrikanist. The job of the white agenda is to absolve the white man and his brutal power scheme that has dehumanized blacks. We must refuse to be agents of anti blackness. The differences amongst blacks can be resolved by dialogue and education. Our differences are not antagonistic. The black man is not the enemy. He is under attack, just as the black woman is, by white supremacy. They want us to finish each other off so that we may stay oppressed. Beware of the stuff they teach at Rhodes/UCT/Wits. Itâ€™s anti black. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
