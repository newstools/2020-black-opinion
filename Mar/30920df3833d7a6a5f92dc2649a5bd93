The reported murders of two South African citizens by the security forces is alarming. It is shocking that President Ramaphosa didn’t address nor acknowledge these deaths – one in Vosloorus, in the East Rand and another in Ravensmead, in Cape Town – at the hands of the police and army. This attitude reminds us how the Marikana massacre was handled. We ask Ramaphosa to not get the people killed by the police and the army under the pretext of preventing us from being killed by coronavirus. Right now the government and coronavirus are neck to neck in taking lives. As of yesterday there were three coronavirus related deaths and two deaths allegedly by the security forces. Black First Land First (BLF) notes that the excessive force used by the security forces, including shutting down spaza shops, is aimed at driving people to buy at white monopoly capital (WMC) owned supermarkets. It’s brutality for profits. Stop the killings for profits now! Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC)
