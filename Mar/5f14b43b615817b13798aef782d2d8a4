Stephen Bantu Biko By Andile Mngxitama It’s not easy to be an adherent of Black Consciousness (BC) because you get to see what the non BC people can’t see. It’s so nice to see how everyone loves Duduzane Zuma. Not so long ago Black First Land First (BLF) was insulted for daring to stand with Duduzane against the evil Afriforum and corrupt National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). The lynch mob of Stellenbosch was out. We are always ten steps ahead because we are standing on the shoulders of a giant – Stephen Bantu Biko. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
