By Andile Mngxitama The Umhlobo Wenene FM and Radio 702 victims of white propaganda should be considered patients and mentally underdeveloped people. Same applies to the Zuma and Gupta hating victims of London and Stellenbosch. These black people should be considered incapable of making any sound contribution to the black agenda. We do not give the responsibility of thinking about the affairs of the race to children. Why should we give such serious responsibility to victims of white propaganda? These people need help. They are not well. It’s irresponsible to take them seriously as adults. We must help them. Some can be saved. With others however, the cancer of white propaganda has destroyed them beyond repair. They can’t be helped…. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
