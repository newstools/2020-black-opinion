Black First Land First (BLF) calls on President Cyril Ramaphosa to turn all voting stations into testing centres for Covid-19, where the people can get tested for free. The Ramaphosa government must stop the systemic suppression of the actual numbers of those infected by deliberately not making provision for the people to be tested. There’s no reason why government can’t provide free testing for all. There also no conceivable reason why government is not forcing the private healthcare sector to open its laboratories for free testing. Voting stations are in the communities and can easily be converted into testing centres. If this government can set up voting stations to get votes, surely it can use these stations to conduct free testing to also save the lives of the voters. The systemic non testing for Covid-19 has to end to prevent the spread of the virus and defeat it. It can be done. It just needs the political will that puts the people and not profits first.
