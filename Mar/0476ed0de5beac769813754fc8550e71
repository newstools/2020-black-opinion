By Andile Mngxitama We had a successful launch yesterday at the Riverlea High School of the four party electoral pact to contest Ward 68 in the City of Johannesburg Municipal By-Elections that is scheduled to take place on 18 March 2020. Black First Land First (BLF), Sakhisizwe Convention (SA), the Patriotic Alliance (PA) and Al Jama-ah are the four organizations that have pledged their support for the historic pact. We have united around a basic program of demands which will enable us to deal with all the important issues affecting the Joburg Municipality. We have agreed to campaign for and support the PA candidate Fuad Erentzen. The most important demands to be addressed by the coalition include jobs; housing; water; electricity; schools; medical clinics; ending drug addiction and peddling; stopping crime; and forging peace among Africans and Coloureds. Following this event BLF leadership had a quick talk amongst ourselves. It’s on! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
