President Nicolas Maduro. Image credit: venezuelanalysis By Andile Mngxitama Black First Land First (BLF) asked Cyril Ramaphosa to suspend rentals and bond payments amongst other things but Stellenbosch won’t allow him to do so. Remember they bought him with R1 billion at the African National Congress (ANC) Nasrec Conference. He owes them. They made him President. Basically the South African government’s economic measures in response to the pandemic has everything to do with the rich profiting from the crisis, and nothing to do with addressing the suffering of the people during this period On the other hand the Venezuelan government on Sunday declared a number of measures to assist the people against the adverse economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. These include: i. a moratorium on dismissals from work until December 2020 – no layoffs was decreed by in 2015 and extended annually since;
ii. provision of food boxes to 7 million families;
iii. 6 months suspension on credit payments to banks – this relates to capital and interest;
iv. 6 months prohibition on termination of telecommunications services;
v. prohibition on termination of internet services;
vi. 6 months suspension on rental payments for homes;
vii. 6 months compensation for property owners,
viii. six months assistance in respect of payrolls of small and medium sized businesses; Comrade Nicholas Maduro and the Venezuelan government – that’s leadership! I WANT TO CRY! Nina your President is wearing oversized soldier gear pretending to be a soldier. We are cursed! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
