By Andile Mngxitama Do you know that the South African government’s R13.85 billion package to deal with the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic is: i. just 7.5% of the wealth of Johann Rupert who is worth R103.4-billion? ii. just 7.4% of the wealth of Nicky Oppenheimer who is worth R102.98-billion? iii. less than the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) money that Steinhoff’s Markus Jooste disappeared by corruption? AND oh, most of it goes to white monopoly capital (WMC) anyway… What a joke!!! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
