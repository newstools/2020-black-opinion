Black First Land First (BLF) notes that the government is already taking care of big business at the expense of the other sectors, in response to the impact of the coronavirus epidemic. Earlier this week government announced its first concession to big business by suspending employersâ€™ contributions to the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF). BLF calls on the Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa, to forthwith provide cash compensation to all tiers of the Arts and Culture sector. Artists are amongst the most affected given the impact of the cancellation of events. Government has to prioritize the people, not business. Artists must be compensated for lost income in this period. There is no excuse for not paying artists and other small businesses.
