BY Andile Mngxitama Just a reminder, the wealth of the Ruperts and Oppenheimers hovers around R100 billion for each family. More specifically Johann Rupert is worth R103.4-billion and Nicky Oppenheimer, R102.98-billion In the last financial year, being the year after removing Jacob Zuma as President, Rupert made R11 billion and the Oppenheimers made R6 billion from their respective investments in the CR17 campaign. They made this money in one year. Also the Oppenheimers have an illegally obtained private international airport inside the OR Tambo International Airport. Just saying – know who runs South Africa (SA) and know that they only throw crumbs at you. In this context the 3 weeks national coronavirus shutdown is about white monopoly capital (WMC) making money. The trains, buses and taxis were packed this morning. This will continue for another two days. By the end of today, another 100 confirmed cases are likely. The Ruperts and Oppenheimers want their economy running and these black bodies are the oil. The infections are being unleashed according to plan. By Thursday SA will likely have over 600 infections. Cyril Ramaphosa aims to hit the 70% target of positive coronavirus infections and give WMC lots of profits at our expense. It’s the ‘herd immunity’ policy that is being implemented. It says, “make them sick, let them die, It’s good for business.” WMC doesn’t donate, it invests. We are in shit!
