By Andile Mngxitama The conspiracy to drive the agenda of white power through coronavirus is exposed by the consensus amongst the main political parties in South Africa (SA). They all agree with the Stellenbosch agenda to subdue the nation through pretending to address the crisis when in fact it’s a complete take over of the economy and society. It’s white supremacy writ large. The Oppenheimers and Ruperts, who are the main opponents of Radical Economic Transformation (RET) have been sanitized and presented as saviors. They have the parliamentary parties in their pocket. The coup happened on the 18th of March when parliament surrendered its powers to the executive and the cooperation of the Members of Parliament (MPs) was bought by granting them full salaries to stay at home. They practically went on holiday and let the country get infected. The R1 billion investment by white monopoly capital (WMC) in the CR17 campaign to buy themselves a president of the country, is now bearing fruit. The white power structure has carte blanche to implement its agenda – there’s a crisis hence thinking is outlawed. Numerous maneuvers in the economy and judiciary are being undertaken during this period. The longer the coronavirus carnage continues, the better the situation is for the total take over. It’s ‘The New Dawn’ of Cyril Ramaphosa! The silence is too loud… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
