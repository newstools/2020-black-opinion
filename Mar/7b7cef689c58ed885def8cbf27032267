By Andile Mngxitama It’s month end. Rental and mortgage bond payments are going to be demanded but there is a lockdown and Ramaphosa doesn’t care. See what caring Presidents have done for their people. Venezuela, led by President Nicholas Maduro, has granted its people numerous benefits for their survival during the current lockdown of the country. These include: i. a moratorium on dismissals from work until December 2020 – the no layoffs benefit was decreed in 2015 and extended annually ever since;
ii. provision of food boxes to 7 million families;
iii. 6 months suspension on credit payments to banks – this relates to capital and interest;
iv. 6 months prohibition on termination of telecommunications services;
v. prohibition on termination of internet services;
vi. 6 months suspension on rental payments for homes;
vii. 6 months compensation for property owners; and
viii. six months assistance in respect of payrolls of small and medium sized businesses. Sister Ntsiki Mazwai is correct. Ramaphosa is looking out for his white monopoly capital (WMC) friends and sponsors. It’s National Lockdown Day 4. The people are hungry, helpless and Ramaphosa doesn’t care. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
