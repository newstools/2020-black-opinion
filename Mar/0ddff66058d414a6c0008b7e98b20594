Dear black artists, You are black before you are artists. All your problems are problems of black people, which were primarily created by white people who ran the apartheid state for the benefit of ALL white people. The fight of white artists against the bad government of the African National Congress (ANC) is not your fight. They are fighting to get back to white power.
You are fighting for black liberation that was promised in 1994 but never delivered. As long as black artists are in coalition with white artists we have good reason to suspect their motives.
Black artists must decide: are you with the colonial white supremacist or with the black liberation project?
There can be no middle ground. We are all in trouble as blacks. We must put Black First, then everything else shall be clear. The ANC government betrayed blacks, not whites. It must be forced to serve blacks, not the beneficiaries of slavery, colonialism and apartheid. White artists are fighting for whiteness which is antithetical to black interests. Yours sincerely
Andile Mngxitama Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
