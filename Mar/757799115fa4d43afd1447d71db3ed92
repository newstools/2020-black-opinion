Photo credit: Creamer Media By Andile Mngxitama Have you seen the respect blacks give the incompetent white chief executive officer (CEO) Andre de Ruyter at Eskom? I’m told that even the red marchers thanked him after shoving some black brother out of the way. Every other day de Ruyter tells us that we are going to be without electricity and we say “Ja Baas”. He tells us that he will hit us with load-shedding for 18 months and we say, “Ja Baas”. Can you imagine what our reaction would have been if the Eskom CEO was a black person? We are sick, sick, sick slaves!!! #BRINGBACKBRIANMOLEFE Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
