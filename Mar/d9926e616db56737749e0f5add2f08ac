By Andile Mngxitama Black First Land First (BLF) has been telling you that Dr Zweli Mkhize was announcing government policy when he said that 60 to 70% of the South African population will get the coronavirus. It’s the ‘herd immunity’ policy. It’s based on letting people die and making shocking profits for white monopoly capital (WMC). Mkhize didn’t tell you that if this mass murder policy of Cyril Ramaphosa is not stopped, 70% of the 59.5 million living in South African will contract the infection and this will result in 41,5 million people being infected (70%); 8 million people being critically ill (19% severe infections); 1 million people dying (2.3% death rate); WMC making obscene profits from all of this; and 30% being freed from the carnage. The other option is the Chinese/Cuban route that saves lives in that all efforts are concentrated in controlling, preventing and defeating the coronavirus pandemic without delay. In this process strict measures that amount to basically shutting down the country are followed. The Ramaphosa government, in cahoots with Stellenbosch and London, has made the decision to follow the ‘herd immunity’ strategy and to thereby inflict devastating misery and death on the population – of which the elderly and those with the most compromised immune systems such as those having HIV, and TB will constitute the 1 million who will die, amongst other things. So South Africa is following the United Kingdom (UK), not China. The thing is Zweli and Ramaphosa are lying to the nation. This is treasonous. And the opposition parties support the murderous policy. They all act at the behest of WMC. Stellenbosch in collaboration with London won’t approve of the Chinese/Cuban route. BLF is keeping vigilant. Your favorite organizations are fast asleep.
