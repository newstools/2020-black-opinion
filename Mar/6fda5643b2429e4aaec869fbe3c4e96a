By Andile Mngxitama The people are crying of hunger. They say, “give us food then we shall stay at home”. This is not defiance. It’s desperate call for help. Black First Land First (BLF) calls on President Cyril Ramaphosa to immediately: 1. Suspend rental payments
2. Give people food or a stipend of R2000 each
3. Turn voting stations into testing centres
4. Prioritize establishing social centers in congested areas. How can a family stay indoors for even a day in a one room shack? Someone get this message through to Ramaphosa. The people are starving… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
