By Andile Mngxitama The video of Matamela laughing at Juju has reminded me of how Juju had previously laughed at me. In 2014, we were working on the party’s election manifesto and there was no expression of the Nationalization of the Banks in the document. So I raised the issue. Juju looked at Floyd, laughed hysterically and asked, “Floyd are we nationalizing the banks?”. I was both confused and offended because we were mos Marxist Leninists what what… I was therefore not suprised when Robin Renwick in his book “How To Steal A Country”, wrote that after meeting Juju and company, he was convinced that they don’t believe in nationalization. But ja, Juju laughed at me kak. It was like he was saying, “chief do you really believe in the nonsense of nationalization?” Karma… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
