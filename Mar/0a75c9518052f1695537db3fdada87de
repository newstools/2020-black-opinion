By Andile Mngxitama I haven’t paid enough attention to the USA political scene but it seems like after decades of two party domination and no chance of a progressive political movement ever making an impact in formal politics, a clever move was hatched to use the Democratic Party to advance a progressive agenda. This explains senators like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. They would never have made it outside of the Democratic Party vehicle. The real big outcome of this strategy employed is the candidature of Bernie Sanders. Of course, the ruling class controls the two dominant political parties in the USA. A Thuma Mina like faction inside the Democratic Party is fighting the mild version of radical economic transformation (RET) of the Democrats. So the first attack against Bernie is inside the Democratic Party. They can‘t believe that a candidate of the poor is using the influence of the Democrats to contest for the position of President. We need to study this development closer Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
