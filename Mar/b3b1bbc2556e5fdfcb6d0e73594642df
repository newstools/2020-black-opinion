By Andile Mngxitama Dear God let’s talk Face to face, Parent to parent… You know I’m not a hypocrite, I speak straight. You, Lord of Lords, have done nothing for us blacks. You allowed all horrors to happen to us, from slavery to permanent poverty. When the AIDS plague came, you let it ravage us blacks mercilessly. It was your servants, like Jacob Zuma, who helped us out of the mass deaths. In South Africa, no black family was not affected. We buried our loved ones to a point where some children literally raised themselves. Lord hear my prayer. This one of coronavirus and Covid-19 is not ours. Let it affect the others and leave us in peace. Open our eyes Father so that we may also remain vigilant against the evil politicians who will use this coronavirus scare to loot our wealth and natural resources. I hope you heard my prayer dear Lord Father and Mother of all. I pray, let the coronavirus stay away from black people my Lord. We have suffered enough and you have done the least for us. Now it’s our turn to be protected. Praise you in the holy names of our black heroes and heroines… Amen Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
