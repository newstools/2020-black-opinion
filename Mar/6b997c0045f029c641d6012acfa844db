AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo By Andile Mngxitama I was once on the same flight with one of the officials who worked in the Presidency under President Zuma. I knew that the chap had access to his boss so I assailed him on why I thought it was unwise for Zuma not to pardon the AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo. The chap brought me into his confidence on the reasons for this. It was all too compelling. But I still felt that they were wrong to keep the King locked up. Now there’s this report of King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo being arrested for assault with an axe. At the Bumbane Great Place, the King apparently walks into the room and asks his son one question: so you want to be King? The young man jumps out of his bed screaming, “Mama”. Yhoo! He jumps out of the window, lands head first; breaks a few ribs; and limps all the way to his mother’s village. Ever looking over his shoulders, he arrives in tears and tatters and cries, “ malume, malume, the King wants to kill me.” For the record, if I’m King and my son is plotting to dethrone me I will take an axe and machete and go upstairs to his bedroom for a smallnyana talk. At the palace, the King laughs as Azenathi Zanelizwe jumps out of the window. He sits on the bed and makes a libation that creates a cloud to cleanse the evil spirits. The King pulls. His lungs swell. He blows a long strong straight cloud to the skies… “You want the throne? Come and get it my son.” THE KING IS KING! AaahZwelibanzi!!!! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
