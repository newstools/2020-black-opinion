By Andile Mngxitama The Oppenheimers/Ruperts, through their agent Cyril Ramaphosa, have won a major propaganda battle (not the war) via the coronavirus pandemic. The R2 billion donation made by these families ostensibly towards easing the impact of the pandemic on the people, (as announced by Ramaphosa last night) is a huge victory for white monopoly capital (WMC) towards capturing the consciousness of the people it has impoverished. We know that the official radical economic transformation (RET) forces inside the African National Congress (ANC) can’t contradict Cyril. If we don’t act the people will, from now on, know the enemy as the savior. We need urgent counter propaganda measures or the people are going to attack the revolutionary forces, in defence of the enemy. Information is power! This victory of the enemy is also an advantage for the revolutionary forces. The people know the names and faces of the enemy. Now let’s educate the masses! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
