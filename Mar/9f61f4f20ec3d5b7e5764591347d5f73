By Andile Mngxitama The desperation of some radical economic transformation (RET) people to get back into some position of power is making them unprincipled and it’s a sure way to betray the progressive agenda. We have seen how some have rushed to embrace people who were not long ago organising well funded marches by white monopoly capital (WMC) against President Zuma. We are told not to criticise the flip floppers because they are now fighting Pravin Gordhan. I’m sorry, didn’t they collaborate with London and Stellenbosch against Zuma when he was locking up Pravin for corruption? We must insist on building a principled movement which will launch a real fight against WMC. Little wonder Johann Rupert has moved only against Black First Land First (BLF) and obtained over 30 High Court interdicts against us. Our fight is real. We aren’t involved in fake wars to fool the poor…. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
