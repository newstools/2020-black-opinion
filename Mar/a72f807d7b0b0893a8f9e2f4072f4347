By Andile Mngxitama I’m convinced that Dunstan Mlambo, the Judge President of the Gauteng Division of the High Court, personally hates Jacob Zuma and the radical economic transformation (RET) program. He vindictively ordered Zuma to personally pay costs in the amount of R10 million. This stems from the challenge Zuma put on the release of the shoddy “state of capture” report of the previous Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela. Mlambo went out of his way to even deny Zuma the right to appeal. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court of Appeal granted Zuma leave to appeal the draconian cost order of Mlambo and his henchmen. When the judiciary is openly biased, then shaking the hand of Avtamat Kalashnikov becomes the only remedy. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
