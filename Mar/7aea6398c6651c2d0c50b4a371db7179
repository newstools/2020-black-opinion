By Andile Mngxitama We aren’t naive. A Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma (NDZ) victory wouldn’t have meant radical economic transformation (RET) implementation from the next day. It would have still been the African National Congress (ANC) with its proven track record of pandering to legalism, bourgeois responsibility and sensitivity to white fears. However, a NDZ victory would have created the conditions to fight for RET. Right now we are on the defensive against the Stellenbosch attack to sustain white monopoly capital (WMC) power. The ANC under Cyril Ramaphosa is a weapon of mass destruction for the Stellenbosch agenda. Those who voted for Ramaphosa voted for what’s going on now. There is no shortcut. We must build a radical front for RET. Opportunism and flip flopping must be rejected. We are not thugs and gangs addicted to Louis Vuitton and Range Rovers.
