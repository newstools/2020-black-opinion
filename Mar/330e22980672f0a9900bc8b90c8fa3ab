By Andile Mngxitama The events around sister Ntsiki Mazwai have sent me back to the wisdom of Black Jesus in Luke 12:49-53: “I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled! 50 But I have a baptism to undergo, and what constraint I am under until it is completed! 51 Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division. 52 From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two and two against three. 53 They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.” Here Jesus was teaching about the revolutionary truth. This truth separates the ethical from the hypothetical; revolutionaries from reactionaries; true prophets from deceivers. When we preach black unity, we don’t mean unity based on lies and deception; we don’t mean uniting with agents of the oppresser. True unity divides, as Jesus teaches us. A line is drawn in the sand. You are either with the people or against them! True revolutionary commitment doesn’t allow us to suspend the truth and pretend that we can unite with the those who have brought nothing but suffering and mayhem to black people. True unity is unity for liberation, unity against the oppressor and his agents. And finally, the bearers of the truth are ridiculed; branded mad and unwanted; and hated by the oppressor. The truth is often in conflict with the comfort that comes from the mercy of the oppressor. Jesus said that he came to set the world on fire! That we get! Chisa!!!
