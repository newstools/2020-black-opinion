By Andile Mngxitama You come to my Facebook wall and say 5G is not harmful. I ask, what’s your evidence? You say, Patrice Motsepe and others would not bring harmful technology to South Africa; and they won’t harm the people they want to make profits from. That’s your argument? You aren’t embarrassed to raise it? Motherfucker you waste my time and act as if you never heard of: i. mines killing people everyday and poisoning others who they send home to die.
ii. 90% of maize in South Africa being GMO – a fucking poison no civilized people eat as a staple diet.
iii. the Marikana workers that were killed for profits.
iv. Big Pharma killing us with its monster medicine including vaccinations
v. junk food being poisonous. We spent day and night researching and verifying our claims and you waste my time with arrogance and stupidity. Voetsek! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
