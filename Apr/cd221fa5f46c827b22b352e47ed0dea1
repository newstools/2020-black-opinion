By Andile Mngxitama I have read Ramaphosa‘s “full speech” of 9 April that was released by the presidency for publication in the media. I searched for how government has practically expressed support for: i. spaza shops;
ii. the informal sector; and
iii. food parcels. Lo and behold, the published speech in text doesn’t mention these three critical areas. At the 18th minute of Ramaphosa’s televised speech, he mumbles quickly over these issues. It is clear to me that it came as an after thought. He just mentioned them to shut up organizations like Black First Land First (BLF). This means that in reality there is no plan or provision for the three sectors. Of course he didn’t bother with the unemployed. By now he should be reporting on the related statistics including: how many food parcels were delivered, how many spaza shops were assisted, how many people in the informal sector were assisted. It seems to me, this man is lying. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
