By Andile Mngxitama How do we assess a political party? Is it by what it says; what it does; or both? What’s its proclaimed agenda? Does it practice what it preaches? Can it advance the Black Agenda? On Wednesday I went live on my Facebook page and critically evaluated the top three parliamentary parties in South Africa (SA) during the COVID-19 crisis. I showed that: 1. The African National Congress (ANC) of Cyril Ramaphosa is carrying out the mandate of the R1 billion CR17 donors.
2. The Democratic Alliance (DA) is the policy and ideological leader of the ‘New Dawn‘ implemented by Ramaphosa.
3. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is the left wing of the ‘New Dawn‘ ideological perspective, with the ANC being its right wing. Those who are unhappy about us exposing their political parties, please note that we are just warming up. Educate! Agitate! Organize!
