By Andile Mngxitama President Ramaphosa’s help to the poor is like this: someone who is very thirsty asks you for water; you tell her “yes you will get a quarter glass of water“; the poor thirsty person celebrates and calls you leadership; you tell her the criteria to get the little water you promised; you explain that to get the water she must: i. run for 1km;
ii. do skipping rope for 30 minutes;
iii. do 100 push-ups;
iv. run another 1km; and
v. repeat all the steps again plus jump over the wall and fight with Botsang Moiloa’s vicious pitbulls. After this process the thirsty person may get the water and you caution her accordingly: “Remember I can’t guarantee that you will get the water because there are many others who need it even more than you. Good luck!” Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
