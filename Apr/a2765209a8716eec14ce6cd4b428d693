By Andile Mngxitama This advert of the Gauteng government which promises lekker food to the hungry during the covid-19 lockdown, and provides a toy phone number to call for such assistance, reminds me of a poster I saw at the Kgosi Mampuru prison when we were locked up there in 2016 for 7 days at the instance of the former Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela. On the 5th day or so, after consuming bad food daily, the older inmates started wetting our appetites with how “today it’s going to be two full chickens and pap for each of us.” In prison you believe nothing! Anyway, when we got to the kitchen we were each confronted by two boiled eggs, a load of pap and some salt. Our spirits simply got dejected. So the following day I saw this very huge, colorful, prison approved, poster, on the wall which had a big title and pictures of all kinds of food that we must eat to stay healthy. Lol. What a cruel joke! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
