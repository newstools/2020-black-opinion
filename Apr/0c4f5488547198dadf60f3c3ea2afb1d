Minister of Finance Tito Mboweni. Image: @TreasurySA/Twitter By Andile Mngxitama On Saturday I dealt with Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s post COVID-19 “new economy” through a live broadcast on Facebook. The main questions concerning this issue were interrogated, namely: 1. Is it new?
2. Is it serfdom or is it freedom?
3. Is it free market populism in defence of white monopoly capital (WMC), or is it in service of the townships?
4. Tito says that Zimbabweans must go home because they take our jobs. Is this not another Democratic Alliance (DA) idea formerly pushed by the erstwhile Johannesburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba?
5. What is the revolutionary response to the above questions? Tito says WMC will be forced to hire South Africans after the COVID-19 crisis failing which the State will not help them. Is that not like saying, when you get to a taxi sit down and then go inside? WMC needs no State help post the crisis! Tito wants to kick out my brothers and sisters from outside South Africa (SA) and give the township economy to WMC. Township residents must own 60% of all spaza shops immediately. They must enter into the necessary cooperation and skills transfers with the Somalis, Pakistanis and Ethiopians through a 10 years exit plan. We must take over all the malls in the township. They belong to the township residents. We must say NO to Tito and his Stellenbosch agenda. Don’t let them divide and conquer us!
