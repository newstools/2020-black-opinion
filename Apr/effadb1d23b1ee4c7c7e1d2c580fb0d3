In the light of the intervention measures (including a dedicated spaza shop support scheme) announced last week by the Minister of Small Business Development, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, to support SMMEs affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, Black First Land First (BLF) hereby presents its intervention below: Township Economic Charter Preamble Our land, our township, our economy! 1. Noting that we are economically disempowered in our own townships; 2. Realizing that we blacks do not own even spaza shops; 3. Realizing further that in the past 24 years into democracy, South African blacks have not obtained ownership of the township economies, more especially in relation to: a. White monopoly capital (WMC) malls; and
b. Pakistani and Bangladeshi businesses. 4. We therefore resolve to adopt this Township Economic Charter to reclaim our land, our townships, and our economies. Principles 5. The township economy belongs to the township. 6. No township business shall be displaced or terminated so as to be replaced by a business(s) owned by anyone who is not a resident of the township. 7. Sixty percent (60%) of all township businesses shall at all times belong to the relevant township. 8. All cooperatives and networks operating in the township shall have at least fifty percent (50%) township residents representation. 9. Fifty percent (50%) of all benefits accruing from all bulk buying in the township shall be owned by the said township’s economy. 10. Seventy five percent (75%) of the businesses in the township shall be owned by the township residents. 11. The Black Business Township Forum shall be established to monitor and regulate all township businesses and economies. 12. All township businesses shall be periodically audited to determine the ownership status of each of the said businesses. Declaration 13.
