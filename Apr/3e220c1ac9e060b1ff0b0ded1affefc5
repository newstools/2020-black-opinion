Black First Land First (BLF) wishes the Father of Radical Economic Transformation (RET), President Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma, a happy 78th birthday and many happy returns. In honor of this day we recommit ourselves to realizing RET as a minimum program to unite all the progressive peoples towards advancing the course of real liberation. BLF also takes this opportunity to acknowledge the 18th anniversary today of the US sponsored 2002 coup attempt on the democratically elected Venezuelan President, Hugo Chávez. To mark President Zuma’s birthday, we invite you to view the befitting documentary – The Revolution Will Not Be Televised (a.k.a. Chavez: Inside the Coup) – which gives deep insight into the life of President Chavez in the seven months leading to the April 2002 coup and his return, about 48 hours later, to power. As we celebrate President Zuma’s birthday, we continue to agitate and organize for a complete defeat and destruction of the London, Washington, Stellenbosch sponsored ‘New Dawn’ program of Ramaphosa that is busy surrendering the country to the enemy. Happy birthday Comrade President Zuma!
