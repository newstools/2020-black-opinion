President Sall of Senegal and President Rajoelina of Madacasgar Madagascar’s President, Andry Rajoelina, has confirmed that Senegalese President, Macky Sall, has placed an order for his country’s natural remedy, Covid-Organics, against coronavirus. Black First Land First (BLF) welcomes Madagascar’s launch of the African Artemisia plant based remedy. We applaud Senegal for showing confidence in Covid-Organics as Africa’s own attempt to use its indigenous knowledge to fight the foreign manufactured COVID-19. Africa has to show more confidence in its own capabilities. BLF is aware that South Africa (SA) would never touch Covid-Organics because President Ramaphosa’s bid for the ANC presidency was funded by Big Pharma like Aspen – which is now waiting to cash in on its investment by pumping its products into the country. Aspen has already proposed a fund to be able to tap into as it makes massive profits from the pandemic. BLF is also aware that the whole western world and its surrogates in the African continent will soon enough drive a massive anti Covid-Organics campaign. The Bill Gates funded World Health Organization (WHO) has already started the campaign against Madacascar. This is because Covid-Organics threatens the mass vaccination program of Bill Gates. We hope that more African countries would show confidence in and collaborate with Madagascar to ensure that this remedy is defended and further developed if needs be.
