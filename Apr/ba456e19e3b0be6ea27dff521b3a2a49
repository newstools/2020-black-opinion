By Andile Mngxitama In 2010 I wrote this piece, “Research on HIV prevention gel put black lives at risk“, in protest against the use of poor black women as laboratory rats. I faced a disciplinary hearing for it. The aids industry, led by Zackie Achmat, and a bunch of racists like Mark Heywood wanted me fired because I questioned a so called study which was really the same thing as the French doctors Camille Locht and Jean-Paul Mira are calling for now. Can you believe these people? Consistent with my approach on the issue, I’ve also objected as the leader of the black consciousness organisation, Black First Land First (BLF), to the use of black bodies for COVID-19 vaccine trials. Anyway the Didier Drogba and Samuel Eto heroic responses to the racist utterances of the French doctors reminded me of what happened ten years ago when the Aids industry wanted to get me dismissed from work. The BBC reported yesterday that Locht, head of research at the Inserm health research group; and Mira, head of intensive care at the Cochin hospital in Paris, suggested after a TV debate that clinical trials be run in Africa to establish whether coronavirus can be cured by a TB vaccine. We agree with the responses of Drogba and Eto. These “murderers” must not take us for “human guinea pigs.” We don’t flip flop. We put black first, always!
