As we said at the beginning, there is no way that this virus comes from us,” he said. director. The laboratory has “a strict regulatory regime and investigative code of conduct, so we are confident” that the new coronavirus did not originate from its facilities, Yuan added. President Trump resumed his attacks on China over his responsibility for the new coronavirus pandemic and threatened the Asian country that will pay the consequences. “If it was a mistake, a mistake is a mistake; but if they were consciously responsible, yes, then there should be consequences,” Trump said, referring to versions that the Covid-19 was created in a Chinese laboratory. The United States is investigating whether the virus actually originated from a virology institute with a highly secure biosecurity laboratory. Reposted from telesurenglish
