By Andile Mngxitama Before President Ramaphosa announced the national lockdown Black First Land First (BLF) asked him, amongst other things, to: i. give us free data; and
ii. give us food. But then, some said that we are negative. Can you imagine what kind of profits the mobile cellular and Wi-Fi networks are making during this time? Also the people caution, “you can’t lock up hungry people”. Hunger will kill them, so Ramaphosa better deliver. In Bolivia, the hungry defied the country’s total lockdown on Tuesday by taking to the streets in protest against the lack of food and provisions. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
