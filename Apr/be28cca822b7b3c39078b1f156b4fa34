By Andile Mngxitama We have received the approval of over 1000 people of the call we made yesterday for, amongst other things, free electricity and data. There’s however a few people who are either honestly lost or victims of the ruling class ideology. They are opposed to this call because they really think that it’s not possible to serve the people. In the meantime I want to reiterate that whites don’t play games. They know who their enemy is and deal with blacks decisively. I was on a very white platform called My Broadband. They had put up my piece in which I argue for FREE ELECTRICITY. Evidently the whites didn’t care to read the article but just supported each other. They commented at length (taking up over 10 pages) convincing themselves that I’m mad and stupid. It’s a good spontaneous response to danger. They know where I’m going and it’s not a place that they want to see. Clever! But the fear is deep even as they try to say that I’m mad etc. The thing that makes me sad is when black people join in the white choir against the black agenda. I accept that Black First Land First (BLF) and I are not acceptable to white people. We blacks must understand this – I take it as badge of honor when whites put scorn and ridicule upon me. I know I’m on the right path… In this context it’s fitting to share with you the following online pieces indicating that free electricity is possible: 1. Sunday Times Mamparas say free electricity not possible 2. Soweto is correct, free electricity is possible! 3. Free electricity in countries with lesser means than SA 4. Is free electricity possible? 5. Andile Mngxitama: “Electricity is a right and we should not pay for it” – NewsLite SA 6. ‘Electricity is a right and we must not pay for it’: Andile Mngxitama on Soweto shutdown Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
