She calls out Bill Gates for ‘continuing the work of Monsanto’ and bring him into sharp focus. “Bill Gates’s so-called philanthropy of ‘pouring money into Africa to feed the poor’ is not what it seems. Gates is working with Monsanto/Bayer and other corporations to push old paradigm Green Revolution agriculture onto the continent.

Not OK”, she says She really is the authority on food sovereignty and the evil GMO industry! Watch: https://youtu.be/MNM833K22LM
