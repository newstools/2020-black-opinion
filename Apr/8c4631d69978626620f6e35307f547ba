By Andile Mngxitama Of course I hate the Hollywood anti black racist motif of the film that Slavoj Žižek uses to explain ideology (see link below). Why was the black man not the one who brought consciousness? I would have preferred a depiction that puts the black radical revolutionary in a position of fighting for the oppressed black masses in a black love struggle for liberation. But the clip does highlight the difficulty we have in trying to bring blacks to black consciousness. Do you think that a Umhlobo Wenene FM or Sunday Times propaganda victim will give up her/his ideology easily? We are in an ideological war. Blacks are fed an illusion even when it’s called Marxist-Leninist. Blacks (EFF) can happily give their votes to the racist Helen Zille and call her the “better devil”, or march against Jacob Zuma with land thieves and say that he is corrupt. Today blacks are happy because Cyril Ramaphosa is promising them a coronavirus grant of R350 a month. Tito Mboweni, tapping into xenophobia, is promising to take the jobs of Zimbabweans and give them to South Africans. He is mobilizing blacks in the townships to kick out our brothers and sisters from outside South Africa so that Shoprite can take over with its Usave eKasi stores. Karl Marx teaches us that the dominant ideas in any society are the ideas of the ruling class. Steve Biko teaches us that, “the most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed”. Freedom hurts. It’s a bitter war to come to Black Consciousness. But it must be done!
