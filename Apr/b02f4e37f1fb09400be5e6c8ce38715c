Getty images BO Staff Writer Former President of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has taken to social media networks to point out the important role that the State should play in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. In a video circulating on social networker platforms said, “[o]nly a strong state is going to take care of the people.” Lula called for progressive policy measures to overcome the coronavirus including a minimum wage; a basic income for informal and ‘precarious’ workers; and heavier taxes on the rich. ‘A strong state will contract as many beds as necessary, make as many investments as necessary so that our researchers can find a vaccine. A weak state does nothing,’ he said in conclusion. Recent Health Ministry statistics indicate that 34 people have died and 3,417 people have been infected by the virus in Brazil. In the meanwhile Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro has been criticized for underplaying the Covid-19 outbreak. He suggests without any evidence that Brazilians may be naturally immune to the coronavirus.
