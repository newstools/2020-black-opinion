By Andile Mngxitama “[W]e have decided that the President, Deputy President, Ministers and Deputy Ministers will each take a one-third cut in their salaries for the next three months. This portion of their salaries will be donated to the Solidarity Fund.” – President Ramphosa during his COVID-19 update on 9 April There’s a right wing ideological consensus amongst the political elite of all the main political parties to save capital instead of obliterating it. That is why, instead of demanding massive redistribution of resources from private capital they have chosen to play father Christmas and donate some money to a fund to buy medical equipment from the same private capital or white monopoly capital (WMC). COVID-19 has exposed this pro WMC political consensus. The time of crisis is the time for making revolutionary demands, not to seek peace with the race and class enemy. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
