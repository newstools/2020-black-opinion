Image credit: internet archives By Andile Mngxitama I’m shocked that imperialism used “women’s rights” to drive its dirty agenda. Today Bill Gates continues the Henry Kissinger agenda of depopulation through “investing” in women’s rights and “education” of the girl child etc. WE NEED TO REEVALUATE WHAT WE THINK WE KNOW. “There exists an extraordinary connection between the rise in demand for abortion rights around the world and US foreign policy. Henry Kissinger, former National Security Advisor and US Secretary of State under Nixon and Ford, is a political ghost who refuses to go away. In the early 1970s he was behind the drafting of the secret ‘Memorandum 200 (declassified in 1980),’ a security report that adopted a horrific and clinical Malthusianism scheme for the furtherance of United States strategic influence abroad. This document sets out an understanding of worldwide population growth as a threat to US interests at home and internationally.” Kissinger used food to force nations to adopt his genocidal policies of population control. Bill Gates uses “development” and his monster vaccines. This is evil. Good morning. Remain vigilant. Let’s think through this together.
