By BO Staff Writer According to the National Transport Movement (NTM) the decision to close down the South African Airways (SAA) and establish a new airline has been concluded between SAA unions and the Minister of Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan. In this regard the government has committed itself to raise funds to the tune of R2.2 billion to secure the severance packages of SAA employees whose contracts will be terminated. Moreover current employees will be given preference to opt for employment in the new airline. The source of the SAA crisis is a white American man called Coleman Andrews who took over R200 million for himself after selling off aircrafts belonging to the national carrier to his friends and promptly allowing them to be leased back to the SAA. While the former Chair of the airline, Dudu Myeni, has been persecuted for wanting transformation of the national carrier where up to 98% of the annual procurement budget has been going to white companies, Andrews continues to enjoy the loot he got from the SAA. The President of Black First Land First (BLF), Andile Mngxitama, expressed his condemnation of the impending closure of SAA. “The national carrier could easily have been bailed out. There is no reason why its debt which stood at approximately R12.7 billion as at September last year, could not have been settled by the government which is now handing out enormous bailouts to white monopoly capital (WMC). To this end Pravin Gordhan on his part has been deliberately running the SAA down,” Mngxitama said. “The crisis at SAA, like that at Eskom, is a deliberate creation to justify privatization (and selling off of the airlines assets) which is the ThumaMina program of Ramaphosa in service of WMC that made him President of the country,” he added.
