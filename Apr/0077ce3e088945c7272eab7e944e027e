By Andile Mngxitama When the COVID-19 pandemic broke in South Africa (SA) we asked the government to seek assistance from Cuba and China. But that option was not profitable for white monopoly capital (WMC) like Aspen which needed more infections and deaths. Now at over 4000 testing positive for the infection and almost 100 deaths the government brings in Cuba and China. There is money to be made and billions already given to the CR17 sponsors. In the meantime a significant number of frontline workers like nurses have not been provided with the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE). Moreover nurses get no compensation, danger allowance, and income tax relief. Ghana, unlike SA, has made impressive provisions for frontline workers in this respect. Healthcare workers in Ghana have given a four months tax break as a token of recognition for their selfless service during the crisis. What’s wrong with Ramaphosa? The government has clearly neglected the nurses who are exposed to the danger of contracting the virus. It has also neglected the private sector doctors who are idling because of the lockdown whilst we need doctors. Can we start at home first guys nje. I’m all for Cuban doctors but it can’t be that our doctors are not engaged. Ramaphosa is further blatantly ignoring Madagascar’s newly developed, cheap, Artemisia plant based remedy against coronavirus namely, Covid-Organics. We say that: i. Frontline workers must be given proper PPE, danger pay, and six months income tax relief.
ii. Covid Organics must be ordered for use from Madagascar.
iii. The Cuban doctors must be welcomed and private sector doctors engaged. All three must be granted and implemented It’s an ugly game being played for profits. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
