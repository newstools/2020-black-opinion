By Andile Mngxitama I have a number of difficulties with the COVID-19 lockdown alcohol ban. These include: i. people who have private bars full of alcohol at their homes are saying no to the sale of alcohol, suggesting it will violate the social distancing rule.
ii. mines are operating where hundreds of workers converge, in violation of the social distancing measure
iii. wines are exported to Europe, one of the epicenters of the CIVID-19 pandemic, from South Africa (SA) where alcohol is banned.
iv. taverns are small black businesses that are shut down because alcohol is banned.
v. alcohol is destroying the black community just like GMO food does. I can’t stand the hypocrisy and double standards going on here. It must also be stated that alcohol abuse is a consequence, not a cause, of poverty and hopelessness. To keep blacks out of the bottle we must deal with the root causes of alcohol abuse. The current condescension towards the poor by people who drink expensive white monopoly capital (WMC) sponsored whiskey every day, doesn’t sit well with me. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
