By Andile Mngxitama Yesterday I asked on Facebook, what makes the Democratic Alliance (DA) the “better devil” in relation to the African National Congress (ANC) – as is claimed by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). No one has since provided an answer. In the absence of a response must we then conclude that people of the political party of the Red Berets don’t think – they just repeat what their leaders say? Moreover, does this mean that people are stupid and can’t even see when they are being sold out? The DA is an unapologetic party of white monopoly capital (WMC) and openly pushes white supremacy. How can it be the “better devil”? In South Africa (SA), the main enemy of black people is WMC which in turn is the economic expression of white supremacy. At the top of the evil White Supremacist pyramid in SA sits Johann Rupert and the Oppenheimers who are politically represented by the DA and Freedom Front Plus (FF+) and propped up by Ramaphosa’s ‘Thuma Mina’ faction of the ANC. The question of not knowing who the enemy is, shows the tragedy of an organisation devoid of revolutionary ideology. Sadly, it also shows just how deeply lost our people are. The devil itself was called the “better devil” and given black peoples votes. No, I can’t forget and I won’t tire of raising this question because it shows that blacks don’t know who the enemy is. This makes blacks dangerous to themselves. We must educate black people however difficult this may be. We must have patience with our people, no matter the amount of insults they throw at us. Coming to consciousness is painful. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
