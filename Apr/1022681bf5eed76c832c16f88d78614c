ii. Johann Rupert lies that his R1 billion is a donation – silence!
iii. White monopoly capital (WMC) breaks lockdown with exporting wines – silence!
iv. the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) allows the planting of 5G towers – silence!
v. President Ramaphosa gives the poor R0.00 – silence!
vi. the police and army brutalise the poor – silence!
vii. some white people openly braai – silence! Then when the Minster of Communications and Telecommunications Stella Ndabeni Abrahams breaks the lockdown rules, there’s a call by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in cahoots with WMC’s Democratic Alliance to criminally charge her. I’m just calling for consistency here. Why is it when WMC and some white people break the law, there is dead silence from these loud ones, but outrage at blacks like Ndabeni Abrahams? Eish they make me tired…. We live already in the matrix of Stellenbosch! Sources 1. Covid-19: Ramaphosa allows Oppenheimers to break lockdown rules 2.
