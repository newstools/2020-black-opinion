Nicky and Jonathan Oppenheimer Black First Land First (BLF) is angered by the decision of the Ramaphosa government to allow Anglo American to force workers to work during the national lockdown. Anglo American is allowed to break the lockdown rules and endanger thousands of black workers yet the black youth are tracked down by the intelligence and arrested for violating those rules. BLF notes that Anglo American is owned by the Oppenheimers who are also one of the main sponsors of the CR17 campaign. They donated R10 million to that campaign to help Ramaphosa win the African National Congress (ANC) conference in Nasrec in December 2017. Anglo American in the Northern Cape doesn’t provide an essential service. It must be shut down now! BLF notes reports that “Anglo American has summoned mineworkers back to work at the Sishen iron ore mine in the Northern Cape after getting approval from the minister of mineral resources and energy.” This is evil! The Ramaphosa government is allowing the police to kill black people saying that they are enforcing the lockdown but allows white monopoly capital to break the lockdown rules for profits. It is unacceptable and must not be tolerated.
