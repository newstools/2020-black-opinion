By Andile Mngxitama We need to be extremely careful not to become USA agents against China. In the bigger scheme of things, China is a friendly force that, from time to time, offends against us. The USA, on the other hand, is the enemy force that seeks to further enslave us to it. The USA is using the incidents of anti black hysteria in China to push its imperialist agenda. Our response to the Chinese anti black acts must be firm, but we must avoid going extreme and becoming agents of the USA unwittingly. The racism of the USA kills blacks every day systematically. We must firmly call on China to sort out this shit failing which we shall act appropriately on Chinese interests in Africa. Iâ€™m beginning to think that the CIA is also running massive social media campaigns against China. We must not fall into the trap. China must respect us. But we are not agents of the USA. NO TO RACISM! NO TO USA IMPERIALISM! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
