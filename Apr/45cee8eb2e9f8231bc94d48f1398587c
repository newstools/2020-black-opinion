By Andile Mngxitama Vladimir Ilyich Lenin – the great Russian revolutionary, the scientist, the artist who danced with the guillotine to end the brutal feudal order of Czar Nicholas II – turned 150 on 22 April. In a tribute to Lenin, which was broadcast live on Wednesday on my Facebook page, I deliberated on the following questions: 1. Where does revolutionary consciousness come from? (ideas of Steve Biko and VI Lenin)
2. Should revolutionaries participate in parliamentary processes?
3. What is the response of revolutionaries to a crisis? (guide to dealing with COVID-19) Watch: https://www.facebook.com/andile.mngxi/videos/1653339751491533/ In the meantime Comrade Lenin, we have seen how some Russian Leninists courageously broke Moscow’s COVID-19 lockdown on Wednesday to celebrate your birthday in Red Square. But the South African phrase-mongers of the party of the Red Berets (EFF) who swear by your name, don’t even know its your birthday. They hide under the bed like the Mensheviks and refuse to precipitate a viral crisis into a revolutionary crisis. They steadfastly hold onto the apron strings of Stellenbosch and London. Putrid! During this global crisis of capital, driven by a virus engineered to enslave all and give rise to a new global Tzar in the form of a smiling evil man Bill Gates, we ask the question you posed back then, WHAT’S TO BE DONE? Vladimir! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
